## Connecting stdio vs. HTTP servers

### stdio

A stdio server is a process the Inspector spawns. Everything positional is the command line:

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector node build/index.js -- --verbose --config /etc/myserver.conf
```

Put `--` before any arguments meant for your server. Without the separator, `--verbose` would be
parsed by the Inspector and never reach the server.

Give the process environment variables with `-e` and a working directory with `--cwd`:

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector -e API_KEY=abc123 -e REGION=us-east-1 --cwd ~/projects/my-server \
  node build/index.js
```

The server's `stderr` lands in the **Console** tab (web) or the Console tab (`o`, TUI), which is where most stdio servers put their diagnostics, so check there first when a connection fails for no visible reason.

### HTTP and SSE

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --server-url https://api.example.com/mcp --transport http \
  --header "X-Tenant: acme"
```

`--transport` accepts `http` (Streamable HTTP) and `sse`. If the server is protected, see [Authorization](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/authorization): no setup is needed in advance, because when the server answers `401` the Inspector runs the OAuth flow described there and retries the connection.

For an HTTP server, also decide its [protocol era](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/protocol-eras). The default is `legacy`; set `modern` or `auto` in Server Settings (or `protocolEra` in the catalog file) to exercise the 2026-07-28 behavior. For an ad-hoc target, pass it at launch with `--protocol-era legacy|auto|modern`.

## Importing an existing client config

On the Servers screen, **Add Servers** can import MCP servers you have already configured
elsewhere instead of retyping them. It parses Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, and VS Code client
configs directly, and it also reads a server's own [MCP Registry](/registry/about) `server.json`.

Import merges into the active [catalog](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/configuration#choosing-servers)
(the Inspector's writable server list). When an imported server's id is already taken, you
choose whether to overwrite, skip or rename it. If you'd rather
not touch your catalog at all, launch against the foreign file read-only instead:

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --config ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

`--config` guarantees the file is served as-is and never written, seeded, or migrated.

## Reviewing an MCP App

[MCP Apps](/extensions/apps/overview) are tools that carry a UI widget. For an automated reviewer (CI or an agent), use the CLI for every check that returns JSON, and open a browser only to inspect the rendered widget.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Probe the security posture without calling the tool">
    ```bash theme={null}
    mcp-inspector --cli --transport http --server-url https://example.com/mcp \
      --method tools/call --tool-name <tool> --app-info --advertise-apps
    ```

    `--advertise-apps` makes the CLI claim MCP Apps support at `initialize`. It is off by default because the CLI cannot render an app, but a server that shows its app tools only to app-capable clients would otherwise report no app.

    One JSON line on stdout; exit `0` if the tool has an app, `2` if not, so an `&&` chain short-circuits:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "hasApp": true,
      "toolName": "get_pros",
      "resourceUri": "ui://pros/view.html",
      "csp": { "connectDomains": ["https://api.example.com"] },
      "permissions": { "clipboard": false },
      "prefersBorder": true,
      "resourceMimeType": "text/html"
    }
    ```

    `csp` and `permissions` (and `domain`, when the resource declares one) live on the UI **resource** rather than the tool, so `--app-info` reads that resource. The tool is never called.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get the full result payload, still with no browser">
    ```bash theme={null}
    mcp-inspector --cli --transport http --server-url https://example.com/mcp \
      --method tools/call --tool-name <tool> --tool-args-json '{"zip":"10001"}' --format json
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch the web Inspector once, loopback-only">
    ```bash theme={null}
    TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
    HOST=127.0.0.1 CLIENT_PORT=6274 MCP_SANDBOX_PORT=6275 \
    MCP_AUTO_OPEN_ENABLED=false MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN="$TOKEN" \
    mcp-inspector --web &
    ```

    Pinning `MCP_SANDBOX_PORT` keeps the address explicit: the app's UI is served from a separate sandbox port, and your automation needs to know where it is.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate one deep link to a rendered widget">
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:6274/?serverUrl=<encoded url>&transport=http&autoConnect=<TOKEN>&openApp=<tool>&appArgs=<base64url(JSON)>&autoOpen=<TOKEN>
    ```

    `appArgs` is the tool's arguments as base64url-encoded JSON, and every deep-link parameter is described under [Deep links](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/web#deep-links). `autoConnect` and `autoOpen` must both equal the session token, since `autoOpen` fires a tool call straight from the URL and needs the same gate as `autoConnect`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait on a deterministic signal instead of sleeping">
    The Apps screen exposes a stable automation contract. Poll these attributes instead of sleeping:

    | Selector | Attribute | Values |
    | - | - | - |
    | `[data-testid="apps-form"]` | `data-app-status` | `idle`, then `loading`, then `ready` or `error` (on `error`, `data-app-error` carries the reason) |
    | `[data-testid="connection-status"]` | `data-status` | `disconnected`, `connecting`, then `connected` or `error` (`data-error-message` has the detail) |
    | `[data-testid="connection-status"]` | `data-deeplink` | `parsed`, `rejected`, or `none` (`none` means no deep link was given, `rejected` means one was refused) |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Docker

A container image is published to GitHub Container Registry for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

```bash theme={null}
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274 ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Read the [session token](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/web#the-session-token) from the container logs, or pin it with `-e MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN=<value>`.

The image defaults to `--web`, bound to `0.0.0.0:6274` with browser auto-open off, and runs as the non-root `node` user (uid `1000`). It sets `DANGEROUSLY_BIND_ALL_INTERFACES=true` because a container must bind the wildcard address to be reachable through `-p`.

<Warning>
  **Keep the `127.0.0.1:` prefix on every published port.** A bare `-p
      6274:6274` publishes on every host interface, putting a backend that spawns
  processes, and the page that discloses its token, on your local network. The
  image's `DANGEROUSLY_BIND_ALL_INTERFACES` covers the container's interfaces,
  not the host's. See [Publish the port on loopback
  only](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/security#publish-the-port-on-loopback-only).
</Warning>

To use the **Apps** tab, also publish the MCP Apps sandbox port, `6275`, and `6278` for an app that declares `_meta.ui.domain`. Publish each on the same port number inside and out, since the browser is handed the in-container port:

```bash theme={null}
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274 -p 127.0.0.1:6275:6275 \
  ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

### Keeping your servers and secrets

The server list, OAuth state and secrets live under `/home/node/.mcp-inspector`, in the container's writable layer, so `--rm` discards them and every run starts empty. Mount a volume there to keep them:

```bash theme={null}
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274 \
  -v mcp-inspector-data:/home/node/.mcp-inspector \
  ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

A container has no OS keychain, so where secrets go depends on that volume:

| Situation | Secret store | Survives a restart? |
| - | - | - |
| **No volume** on `/home/node/.mcp-inspector` | Memory | No, session only |
| **With** that volume | `secrets.json` on the volume, mode `0600` | Yes |

If you bind-mount a host directory instead of a named volume, it keeps its host ownership, so on Linux add `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` or `chown` it to uid `1000`, or saves fail with `EACCES`. Don't bind-mount the secrets file on its own: it isn't recognized as durable, and it can't be replaced atomically.

<Warning>
  **Mounting that volume turns on file storage of secrets, and without a key the file is plaintext.** Every OAuth token acquired, and every client secret and stdio `env:` value you save, is then written to `secrets.json` on the volume. It is readable by root and every member of the host's `docker` group, and by anyone who gets a backup, snapshot or copy of the volume.

  Give it a key, generated into a file that only you can read and that sits outside the volume, its backups and any repository:

  ```bash theme={null}
  mkdir -p ~/.config/mcp-inspector
  (umask 077 && openssl rand -base64 32 > ~/.config/mcp-inspector/secret-key)
  ```

  Even encrypted, secrets on disk carry moderate risk. See [what the file store protects against](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/security#what-the-file-store-protects-against).
</Warning>

Hand the key to the container **as a file** with `MCP_INSPECTOR_SECRET_KEY_FILE`, not as an environment variable. A key passed with `-e MCP_INSPECTOR_SECRET_KEY=…` is readable by anyone who can run `docker inspect` or `docker exec`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="docker run">
    ```bash theme={null}
    docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274 \
      -v mcp-inspector-data:/home/node/.mcp-inspector \
      -v "$HOME/.config/mcp-inspector/secret-key:/run/secrets/mcp_inspector_secret_key:ro" \
      -e MCP_INSPECTOR_SECRET_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/mcp_inspector_secret_key \
      ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Compose secrets">
    ```yaml theme={null}
    services:
      inspector:
        image: ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector
        ports: ["127.0.0.1:6274:6274"]
        volumes: ["mcp-inspector-data:/home/node/.mcp-inspector"]
        environment:
          MCP_INSPECTOR_SECRET_KEY_FILE: /run/secrets/mcp_inspector_secret_key
        secrets: [mcp_inspector_secret_key]
    secrets:
      mcp_inspector_secret_key:
        file: ${HOME}/.config/mcp-inspector/secret-key
    volumes:
      mcp-inspector-data:
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Without Swarm, Compose secrets are bind mounts that keep the host file's owner and mode, so the `0600` key file must be owned by uid `1000`. On a Linux host where your uid is different, run `sudo chown 1000 ~/.config/mcp-inspector/secret-key` rather than loosening its mode. Supply the **same** key on every run.

If the key file is missing, unreadable or empty, or both key variables are set, the Inspector **refuses to read or write the secrets file** rather than falling back to plaintext, and says why in the log and in the settings dialogs' footer. Everything else about the store (selection order, location, permissions) is under [Where secrets are stored](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/configuration#where-secrets-are-stored).

### Health checks and other modes

The image's `HEALTHCHECK` probes the web UI at the address `HOST` binds. `--cli` and `--tui` have no web server, so the probe detects those modes from the container's arguments and reports healthy while they run. An external orchestrator (a Kubernetes probe, a Compose `healthcheck`) can call `GET /healthz` on the web port, which needs no token and returns only `{"status":"ok"}`.

`<target>` below is an [ad-hoc target](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/configuration#ad-hoc-targets): a positional stdio command, or `--server-url <url> --transport http`.

```bash theme={null}
docker run --rm ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli <target> --method tools/list
```

<Warning>
  **If you remap the published port, set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.** With `-p
      127.0.0.1:8080:6274` the browser's origin becomes `http://localhost:8080`,
  which no longer matches the in-container port, and connects will `403`. Either
  run `-e CLIENT_PORT=8080 -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080`, or set `-e
      ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080,http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
</Warning>

## Hosting on a network

The Inspector binds `127.0.0.1` by default and its backend spawns processes, so treat exposing it to a network as a deliberate decision.

The Inspector refuses to bind the **wildcard** all-interfaces addresses (`0.0.0.0`, `::`, and every equivalent spelling) unless you set `DANGEROUSLY_BIND_ALL_INTERFACES=true`. Binding a **specific** address is allowed with no opt-in, because that's one deliberate exposure rather than every interface at once, which is the shape DNS-rebinding attacks target.

| Goal | What to do |
| - | - |
| **Reach it from another machine on the LAN** | `HOST=192.168.1.50`. The default origin allow-list follows the bind host, so `http://192.168.1.50:6274` is accepted with no further config. |
| **Behind TLS or a reverse proxy** | The browser's `Origin` becomes the public origin, which won't match the bind host. Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://inspector.example.com`, and for MCP Apps set `MCP_SANDBOX_FULL_ADDRESS` (see below). |
| **Wildcard bind (containers)** | Set `DANGEROUSLY_BIND_ALL_INTERFACES=true`. Loopback access still works out of the box; reaching it at a non-loopback address needs `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. |

<Warning>
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` **replaces** the default list rather than merging with it. List every origin you'll browse from, including the loopback forms you want to keep:

  ```
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:6274,http://127.0.0.1:6274,http://192.168.1.50:6274
  ```

  Each entry must include the scheme; a scheme-less value is dropped with a warning. A blank value does **not** disable the check; it falls back to the default. There is no knob to turn origin validation off.
</Warning>

Two further caveats when going off loopback:

* **MCP Apps need their sandbox port reachable too.** It's a separate listener (`6275` by default, set with `MCP_SANDBOX_PORT`), so expose or forward it alongside the web port.
* **Behind TLS or a reverse proxy, give MCP Apps their public addresses.** By default the sandbox is advertised as `http://<bind host>:6275`, which an `https://` page blocks as mixed content. Set `MCP_SANDBOX_FULL_ADDRESS` (for example `https://inspector-sandbox.example.com/sandbox`) and, for apps that declare `_meta.ui.domain`, `MCP_APP_ORIGIN_FULL_ADDRESS` (for example `https://inspector-apps.example.com`). Each needs its own hostname or port; an address that shares the Inspector's origin is refused.
* **MCP Apps can't render at a bare IPv6 literal.** A bracketed IPv6 literal isn't a valid CSP host-source, so browse at a name or an IPv4 address.

Whatever the shape: keep authentication on. Do not set `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH` on anything reachable by anyone but you. The reasoning is under [Security](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/security#the-web-backend-and-its-api-token).

## Keeping a connection open with mcpdo

When an exploration spans many calls (a multi-step flow over one session, a log you watch, an agent using a server's tools mid-session), reconnecting for every `--cli` invocation gets in the way. [mcpdo](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/mcpdo) holds the connection for you:

```bash theme={null}
mcpdo connect my-server
mcpdo @my-server tools/call --task start_job size:=large   # task-augmented; blocks until the task finishes
mcpdo @my-server tools/call get_job_report
mcpdo @my-server logging/tail          # long-lived; Ctrl-C to stop
mcpdo disconnect my-server
```

A connection runs one call at a time, so commands against the same connection from other shells wait their turn.

The daemon that holds the connection starts automatically and exits about a minute after the last connection closes. Read [The mcpdo connection daemon](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/security#the-mcpdo-connection-daemon) before using it on a shared machine.

## Development workflow

A loop that works well in practice:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with the CLI">
    `--method initialize` confirms the server starts, handshakes, and reports
    the capabilities you expect, in one second, with a machine-readable answer.
    Most "it doesn't work" turns out to be here.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to the web client for exploration">
    Schema-driven forms, rendered results, and the Protocol tab beside them make
    it fast to find the case where a tool misbehaves.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the edges">
    Invalid inputs, missing required prompt arguments, concurrent calls, and,
    for HTTP servers, both protocol eras. Verify the *errors* are as intentional
    as the successes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Lock it in with the CLI">
    Turn what you found into a CI assertion: pipe the CLI's `--format json`
    output to `jq -e` with `--stored-auth-only`, so a missing token fails fast
    instead of starting interactive OAuth. See [Verify a server in
    CI](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/cli#verify-a-server-in-ci) for the full
    command.
  </Step>
</Steps>
