# CLI client

> Scripting the MCP Inspector: methods, output formats, exit codes, and CI recipes

Each CLI run connects to a server, invokes the single request you name with `--method`, prints the result, and exits. That makes it a good fit for CI pipelines, shell one-liners, and coding agents that need to verify a server change immediately.

```bash theme={null}
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js --method tools/list
```

<Tip>
  Running several commands against the same server, or a flow that spans one
  session (tasks, subscriptions, elicitation)? The [mcpdo connection
  client](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/mcpdo) connects once and keeps the
  connection open between commands.
</Tip>

The examples below use the installed `mcp-inspector` binary. Without a global install, prefix each command with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` instead, as above.

## Choosing a server

The CLI accepts a positional command (stdio), a `--server-url` (HTTP/SSE), or a named server out of a catalog or config file:

```bash theme={null}
# stdio: everything positional is the command to spawn
mcp-inspector --cli node build/index.js --method tools/list

# HTTP
mcp-inspector --cli https://api.example.com/mcp --transport http --method tools/list

# From a file
mcp-inspector --cli --config ./mcp.json --server myserver --method tools/list
```

When the server comes from a file, its per-server settings (headers, timeouts, OAuth, [protocol era](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/protocol-eras), and roots) apply to the connection, resolved exactly as the TUI and web client resolve them. A `--header` flag overrides the file's headers for that run while leaving its timeouts and OAuth in place.

Later examples abbreviate whichever of these forms you use, along with its `--transport` or `--config`/`--server` flags, as `<server>`.

<Note>
  **The config file is the only durable way to give a run its
  [roots](/specification/draft/client/roots):** there is no roots flag, and the
  CLI has no `roots/set` method. Roots configured for a server are advertised at
  connect, so a server that calls `roots/list` (as
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` does, to learn its allowed
  directories) gets them.
</Note>

See [Configuration and flags](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/configuration) for `--catalog` vs. `--config`, the `--` separator, and the shared server-selection flags.

## Methods

| `--method` | Required companions | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| `initialize` | None | Connect-only probe: `{serverInfo, protocolVersion, capabilities, instructions}`. |
| `tools/list` | None | `--strict` turns its schema portability check into a gate (see [CI gates](#ci-gates)). |
| `tools/call` | `--tool-name`, plus optional `--tool-arg` / `--tool-args-json` | |
| `resources/list` | None | |
| `resources/read` | `--uri` | |
| `resources/templates/list` | None | |
| `resources/directory/read` | `--uri`, plus optional `--cursor` | One page at a time; pass back the previous page's `nextCursor`. |
| `prompts/list` | None | |
| `prompts/get` | `--prompt-name`, plus optional `--prompt-args` | |
| `logging/setLevel` | `--log-level` | Legacy era only; modern servers opt in per request instead. |
| `skills/list` | None | `--verify` checks the skills returned (see [CI gates](#ci-gates)). |
| `skills/get` | `--uri` | Same `--verify` option. |
| `servers/list` | None | Read the catalog **without connecting** to anything. |
| `servers/show` | `--server` | Same, for one entry. |
| `servers/add` | `--server`, plus a positional target or `--server-url` | Write the catalog without connecting (see [Editing the catalog](#editing-the-catalog)). |
| `servers/edit` | `--server`, plus what to change | Same. |
| `servers/remove` | `--server` | Same. |

Stream- or session-only methods (`logging/tail`, for example) are rejected, since a process that exits can't hold a stream open.

### Passing arguments

`--tool-arg` takes `key=value` and **coerces** each value by JSON-parsing it when it parses, so `count=1` and `zip=10001` both send numbers. A value that is not valid JSON (`zip=012`, a bare word) is sent as a string, and a string is then converted to the type the tool's input schema declares for that property, so `zip=012` against a numeric `zip` still sends `12`:

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --cli <server> --method tools/call --tool-name mytool \
  --tool-arg key=value --tool-arg count=1 --tool-arg 'options={"format":"json"}'
```

`--tool-args-json` takes the whole argument object at once and skips the `key=value` parsing, so `{"zip":"10001"}` sends the string `"10001"` rather than a number. The schema conversion still applies to string values, so this only keeps a string a string when the schema types that property as a string (or doesn't declare it). The two flags are mutually exclusive:

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --cli <server> --method tools/call --tool-name mytool \
  --tool-args-json '{"zip":"10001"}'
```

## Output

`--format text` (the default) pretty-prints for humans. `--format json` emits a single JSON object on stdout with no banners, so the whole output pipes cleanly:

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --cli <server> --method tools/list --format json | jq '.result.tools[].name'
```

## Probing MCP Apps

`--app-info` reports whether a tool ships an [MCP App](/extensions/apps/overview) UI (its `ui://` resource, CSP, and permissions) **without calling the tool**, so a pipeline can decide whether it needs a browser before invoking anything:

```bash theme={null}
# One tool -> one JSON line
mcp-inspector --cli <server> --method tools/call --tool-name my_tool --app-info
# {"hasApp":true,"toolName":"my_tool","resourceUri":"ui://...","csp":{...},"permissions":{...}}

# Every tool -> NDJSON, one line each, over a single connection
mcp-inspector --cli <server> --method tools/list --app-info | jq -c 'select(.hasApp)'
```

Exit codes distinguish the outcomes: a tool with an app exits `0`, one with no app exits `2`, and a missing tool exits `5`, so a typo isn't mistaken for "no app". A probe failure (unreadable UI resource, malformed `resourceUri`) is reported in a `resourceError` field rather than aborting, so one bad tool never kills a whole listing.

The CLI can't render an App, so by default it doesn't advertise the MCP Apps extension at `initialize`. A server that exposes its App tools only to clients claiming App support will then look app-less (exit `2`). Add `--advertise-apps` to claim the extension for that run.

<Note>
  `tools/list --app-info` always emits NDJSON (one line per tool) regardless of
  `--format`; `--format json` reshapes only the single-tool output of
  `tools/call --app-info`.
</Note>

## Exit codes and error envelopes

Every non-zero exit maps to a stable failure class, so a caller can branch on *why* without scraping prose:

| Code | Meaning |
| - | - |
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Usage or unexpected error (the catch-all), including an unreadable secret store or OAuth state file. |
| `2` | No MCP App found on the tool (`--app-info` probe). |
| `3` | Server requires authentication (HTTP 401/403, or an SDK authorization error). |
| `4` | Server unreachable (DNS, connection refused, timeout, `fetch failed`). |
| `5` | Tool error: `tools/call` returned `isError: true`, or the tool wasn't found. |
| `6` | `--strict` found an error-severity tool-schema portability problem. |
| `7` | `--verify` found a skill that violates SEP-2640 (conformance, digest, or size mismatch). |
| `8` | `--verify` couldn't check every skill within its read bounds. |
| `9` | `--verify --require-digests` found a skill that advertises no digests. |

On any non-zero exit the CLI also writes a **single JSON line to stderr**:

```json theme={null}
{
  "error": {
    "code": "auth_required",
    "message": "Unauthorized",
    "status": 401,
    "url": "https://api.example/mcp"
  }
}
```

The envelope carries `code` and `message` always, plus `cause` (the underlying error, such as a DNS failure), `status` (the HTTP status) and `url` when known. Query-string secrets in a URL are redacted. `code` is a stable name for the failure: `auth_required`, `unreachable`, `tool_not_found`, `tool_is_error`, `no_app`, `schema_unportable`, `store_unavailable`, `oauth_state_unrecognized`, or the catch-all `error`, among others.

Because it's one line, a caller can parse it with `2>&1 | tail -1 | jq .error`.

A `tools/call` that returns `isError: true` still prints its payload, but exits `5`, so an `&&` chain doesn't proceed on a failed call.

## Authorization in scripts

By default the CLI runs the same loopback OAuth flow as the TUI: it opens a browser and waits on a localhost callback that a CI job can't complete. Two flags make non-interactive runs predictable:

* `--stored-auth-only`: never start interactive OAuth or step-up, and never auto-open a browser. Use tokens from the shared store if present, otherwise fail immediately with `auth_required`. This is the flag CI wants.
* `--use-stored-auth`: reuse a token that the web Inspector already obtained on this machine, refreshing it first when a refresh token is stored. It looks the token up by URL, so it requires `--server-url`.

Without either, and with no TTY on stdin or stderr, the CLI fails fast with `auth_required` rather than hanging for fifteen minutes on a callback nobody will complete.

See [Authorization](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/authorization) for the full flow, the web-to-CLI handoff, and `--print-handoff`.

## Recipes

### Verify a server in CI

```bash theme={null}
set -euo pipefail

# Fail the build if the server can't be reached or doesn't expose the tool
mcp-inspector --cli --config ./ci-servers.json --server my-server \
  --stored-auth-only --method tools/list --format json \
  | jq -e '.result.tools | map(.name) | index("get_weather")' > /dev/null
```

### CI gates

Three flags turn a check into a non-zero exit, each with its own code so a job can tell the failures apart:

* `--strict` (with `tools/list`): reports tool-schema portability problems in full on stderr (path, issue, suggested fix) and exits `6` if any is error-severity. Without it, `tools/list` prints only a one-line count. Under `--format json` the findings are folded into the output as `schemaFindings`.
* `--verify` (with `skills/list` or `skills/get`): runs the SEP-2640 conformance and digest checks, writes one JSON report per skill on stdout, and exits `7` on a violation or `8` when the read bounds stopped it before every skill was checked. `--skill-catalog-max-skills` and `--skill-catalog-max-bytes` set those bounds.
* `--require-digests` (with `--verify`): exits `9` for a skill that advertises no digests, instead of reporting it as unverifiable and exiting `0`.

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --cli <server> --method tools/list --strict > /dev/null
mcp-inspector --cli <server> --method skills/list --verify --require-digests
```

### Branch on the failure class

```bash theme={null}
if out=$(mcp-inspector --cli "$URL" --transport http --method tools/list 2>err.json); then
  echo "$out"
else
  case $? in
    3) echo "needs auth: run the web inspector once to sign in" ;;
    4) echo "server unreachable" ;;
    *) jq .error < err.json ;;
  esac
fi
```

### Smoke-test every tool that has a UI

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --cli "$URL" --transport http --method tools/list --app-info \
  | jq -r 'select(.hasApp) | .toolName'
```

### Inspect a catalog without connecting

```bash theme={null}
mcp-inspector --cli --catalog ~/.mcp-inspector/mcp.json --method servers/list
mcp-inspector --cli --catalog ~/.mcp-inspector/mcp.json --method servers/show --server my-server
```

<Warning>
  `servers/show` redacts secret-bearing fields (`env` values, sensitive headers,
  OAuth client secrets), but it does **not** scrub credentials embedded in a
  server `url` (userinfo or query tokens) or in stdio `args`. Treat raw URL and
  `detail` fields as sensitive before pasting them into an issue.
</Warning>

### Editing the catalog

`servers/add`, `servers/edit`, and `servers/remove` write the catalog without connecting to anything. They go through the same code as the web client's server list, so `env` values and client secrets land in the [secret store](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector/configuration#where-secrets-are-stored) exactly as they would from the UI, and a running web client picks up the change.

```bash theme={null}
# Add: the positional target or --server-url describes the entry, not a server to connect to
mcp-inspector --cli node build/index.js -e API_KEY=secret --method servers/add --server my-server

# Edit: change the target, -e, --cwd, --header, or --protocol-era, or rename it
mcp-inspector --cli --method servers/edit --server my-server --rename my-renamed-server

# Remove the entry and its stored secrets
mcp-inspector --cli --method servers/remove --server my-renamed-server
```

Only the writable catalog (`--catalog`, `MCP_CATALOG_PATH`, or the default) can be written; `--config` is refused. With an in-memory secret store, a write that supplies `-e` values (and a `--rename`) is refused, since the secrets would be lost when the run exits.

## Proxies

Connections to remote HTTP/SSE servers honor the conventional proxy variables: `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` (and their lowercase forms) select the proxy and `NO_PROXY` exempts hosts. No Inspector-specific flag is needed, and the proxy agent is loaded lazily, so runs without a proxy pay nothing. The same applies to the web client's backend.
