# Skills Over MCP Charter

> Charter for the MCP Skills Over MCP Working Group.

## Group Type

**Working Group**

## Mission Statement

The Skills Over MCP Working Group defines how "agent skills" — rich, structured
instructions for agent workflows — are discovered, distributed, and consumed through MCP.
Native skills support in host applications demonstrates strong demand, and the group
emerged from discussion on [SEP-2076 — Agent Skills as a First-Class MCP Primitive](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2076),
which raised open questions about whether existing MCP primitives suffice or what
conventions to standardize. The WG produces specification extensions, reference
implementations, and coordination artifacts because solutions touch the protocol spec,
registry schema, SDK implementations, and client behavior.

[SEP-2640 — Skills Extension](/seps/2640-skills-extension) is Final. The WG maintains
the official [Skills extension](/extensions/skills/overview)
(`io.modelcontextprotocol/skills`) in
[modelcontextprotocol/ext-skills](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-skills).
Current work focuses on implementation support, interoperability, and evolution
of the published extension.

## Scope

### In Scope

* **Specification Work**: Maintain and evolve the Skills extension, with changes
  tracked in the [decision log](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-skills/blob/main/docs/decisions.md);
  propose related core protocol changes through the SEP process
* **Reference Implementations**: SDK components and reference servers demonstrating
  skill discovery and consumption patterns
* **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Coordination with Registry WG (skills discovery/distribution,
  registry schema changes), Agents WG (skill activation, server metadata consumption),
  Primitive Grouping IG (progressive disclosure patterns), and external projects including
  the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) spec (content format and well-known URI
  discovery), FastMCP, and PydanticAI
* **Documentation**: Specification sections and guidance covering skill authoring,
  discovery, and consumption

### Out of Scope

* **Registry schema decisions**: Schema ownership belongs to the Registry WG; this WG
  contributes requirements but does not own the schema
* **Client implementation mandates**: We can document patterns but not require specific
  client behavior
* **Plugin/bundle packaging**: Installable bundles (skills + servers + subagents +
  configuration as a single artifact) — surfaced by use cases but belongs to a broader
  packaging effort

### Related Groups

* **Agents WG** — How agents consume server metadata, skill activation
* **Registry WG** — Skills discovery/distribution, registry schema changes
* **Primitive Grouping IG** — Progressive disclosure patterns

## Deliverables & Success Metrics

### Completed Milestones

* [SEP-2640](/seps/2640-skills-extension) is **Final**, merged on September 13, 2026.
* The official specification is published in [ext-skills](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-skills/blob/main/specification/stable/skills.mdx), with a [website overview](/extensions/skills/overview).
* [Skills conformance scenarios](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/conformance/pull/330) were merged on September 11, 2026.

### Current Work

Track proposals, implementation work, and coordination in
[ext-skills issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-skills/issues),
with links to SDK or client issues where the implementation lives.
Owners, progress, and priorities are maintained there rather than in this charter.

### Success Criteria

* **Specification**: A published Resources-based Skills extension — achieved with Final SEP-2640.
* **Implementation**: SDK and host implementations that pass the applicable conformance scenarios.
* **Interoperability**: Independent MCP servers and clients that discover and load skills consistently.
