## Common installation issues

### Windows installation issues: errors in WSL

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:

**OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

* Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
* Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

**Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Linux installation issues: permission errors

When installing Claude Code with npm, you may encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (eg. `/usr`, or `/usr/local`).

#### Recommended solution: Migrate to local installation

The simplest solution is to migrate to a local installation:

```bash
claude migrate-installer
```

This moves Claude Code to `~/.claude/local/` and sets up an alias in your shell configuration. No `sudo` is required for future updates.

After migration, restart your shell, and then verify your installation:

```bash
which claude  # Should show an alias to ~/.claude/local/claude
claude doctor # Check installation health
```

#### Alternative solution: Create a user-writable npm prefix for global installs

You can configure npm to use a directory within your home folder:

```bash
# First, save a list of your existing global packages for later migration
npm list -g --depth=0 > ~/npm-global-packages.txt

# Create a directory for your global packages
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use the new directory path
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global

# Note: Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or other appropriate file for your shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply the new PATH setting
source ~/.bashrc

# Now reinstall Claude Code in the new location
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Optional: Reinstall your previous global packages in the new location
# Look at ~/npm-global-packages.txt and install packages you want to keep
```

This solution:

* Avoids modifying system directory permissions
* Creates a clean, dedicated location for your global npm packages
* Follows security best practices

#### System Recovery: If you have run commands that change ownership and permissions of system files or similar

If you've already run a command that changed system directory permissions (such as `sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn) /usr && sudo chmod -R u+w /usr`) and your system is now broken (for example, if you see `sudo: /usr/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set`), you'll need to perform recovery steps.

##### Ubuntu/Debian Recovery Method:

1. While rebooting, hold **SHIFT** to access the GRUB menu

2. Select "Advanced options for Ubuntu/Debian"

3. Choose the recovery mode option

4. Select "Drop to root shell prompt"

5. Remount the filesystem as writable:
   ```bash
   mount -o remount,rw /
   ```

6. Fix permissions:

   ```bash
   # Restore root ownership
   chown -R root:root /usr
   chmod -R 755 /usr

   # Ensure /usr/local is owned by your user for npm packages
   chown -R YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME /usr/local

   # Set setuid bit for critical binaries
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/su
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/passwd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/newgrp
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/gpasswd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chsh
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chfn

   # Fix sudo configuration
   chown root:root /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chmod 4755 /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chown root:root /etc/sudo.conf
   chmod 644 /etc/sudo.conf
   ```

7. Reinstall affected packages (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   # Save list of installed packages
   dpkg --get-selections > /tmp/installed_packages.txt

   # Reinstall them
   awk '{print $1}' /tmp/installed_packages.txt | xargs -r apt-get install --reinstall -y
   ```

8. Reboot:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

##### Alternative Live USB Recovery Method:

If the recovery mode doesn't work, you can use a live USB:

1. Boot from a live USB (Ubuntu, Debian, or any Linux distribution)

2. Find your system partition:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

3. Mount your system partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt  # replace sdXY with your actual system partition
   ```

4. If you have a separate boot partition, mount it too:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot  # if needed
   ```

5. Chroot into your system:

   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo chroot /mnt

   # For Arch-based systems:
   sudo arch-chroot /mnt
   ```

6. Follow steps 6-8 from the Ubuntu/Debian recovery method above

After restoring your system, follow the recommended solution above to set up a user-writable npm prefix.

## Auto-updater issues

If Claude Code can't update automatically (see [Update Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#update-claude-code) for how updates work):

### For permission errors

This is typically due to permission issues with your npm global prefix directory. You have several options:

1. **Migrate to local installation** (recommended): Run `claude migrate-installer` to move to a local installation that avoids permission issues entirely
2. **Update manually**: Run `claude update` with appropriate permissions
3. **Fix npm permissions**: Follow the [recommended solution](#recommended-solution-create-a-user-writable-npm-prefix) above (more complex)

### To disable auto-updates

If you prefer to control when Claude Code updates:

```bash
# Via configuration
claude config set autoUpdates false --global

# Or via environment variable
export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1
```

### To check your installation

* **Current version and diagnostics**: Run `claude doctor`
* **Check for updates**: Run `claude update`
* **View update settings**: Run `claude config get autoUpdates --global`
* **Verify installation location**: Run `which claude` - if this shows an alias pointing to `~/.claude/local/claude`, you're using the recommended local installation

## Permissions and authentication

### Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the `/permissions` command. See [Permissions docs](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#configuring-permissions).

### Authentication issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems:

1. Run `/logout` to sign out completely
2. Close Claude Code
3. Restart with `claude` and complete the authentication process again

If problems persist, try:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json
claude
```

This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.

## Performance and stability

### High CPU or memory usage

Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file

### Command hangs or freezes

If Claude Code seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart

### ESC key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals

If you're using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the ESC key doesn't interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains' default shortcuts.

To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Click the "Configure terminal keybindings" hyperlink next to "Override IDE Shortcuts"
3. Within the terminal keybindings, scroll down to "Switch focus to Editor" and delete that shortcut

This will allow the ESC key to properly function for canceling Claude Code operations instead of being captured by PyCharm's "Switch focus to Editor" action.

## Getting more help
