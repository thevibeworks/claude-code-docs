# Workspaces

Organize API keys, manage team access, and control costs with workspaces.

---

Workspaces provide a way to organize your API usage within an organization. Use workspaces to separate different projects, environments, or teams while maintaining centralized billing and administration.

## How workspaces work

Every organization has a **Default Workspace** that cannot be renamed, archived, or deleted. When you create additional workspaces, you can assign API keys, members, and resource limits to each one.

Key characteristics:
- **Workspace identifiers** use the `wrkspc_` prefix (e.g., `wrkspc_01JwQvzr7rXLA5AGx3HKfFUJ`)
- **Maximum 100 workspaces** per organization (archived workspaces don't count)
- **Default Workspace** has no ID and doesn't appear in list endpoints
- **API keys** are scoped to a single workspace and can only access resources within that workspace

## Workspace roles and permissions

Members can have different roles in each workspace, allowing fine-grained access control.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Workspace User | Use the Workbench only |
| Workspace Developer | Create and manage API keys, use the API |
| Workspace Admin | Full control over workspace settings and members |
| Workspace Billing | View workspace billing information (inherited from organization billing role) |

### Role inheritance

- **Organization admins** automatically receive Workspace Admin access to all workspaces
- **Organization billing members** automatically receive Workspace Billing access to all workspaces
- **Organization users and developers** must be explicitly added to each workspace

<Note>
The Workspace Billing role cannot be manually assigned. It's inherited from having the organization billing role.
</Note>

## Managing workspaces

<Note>
Only organization admins can create workspaces. Organization users and developers must be added to workspaces by an admin.
</Note>

### Via the Console

Create and manage workspaces in the [Claude Console](/settings/workspaces).

#### Create a workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open workspace settings">
    In the Claude Console, go to **Settings > Workspaces**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a new workspace">
    Click **Add Workspace**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the workspace">
    Enter a workspace name and select a color for visual identification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the workspace">
    Click **Create** to finalize.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To switch between workspaces in the Console, use the **Workspaces** selector in the top-left corner.
</Tip>

#### Edit workspace details

To modify a workspace's name or color:

1. Select the workspace from the list
2. Click the ellipsis menu (**...**) and choose **Edit details**
3. Update the name or color and save your changes

<Note>
The Default Workspace cannot be renamed or deleted.
</Note>

#### Add members to a workspace

1. Navigate to the workspace's **Members** tab
2. Click **Add to Workspace**
3. Select an organization member and assign them a [workspace role](#workspace-roles-and-permissions)
4. Confirm the addition

To remove a member, click the trash icon next to their name.

<Note>
Organization admins and billing members cannot be removed from workspaces while they hold those organization roles.
</Note>

#### Set workspace limits

In the **Limits** tab, you can configure:

- **Rate limits**: Set limits per model tier for requests per minute, input tokens, or output tokens
- **Spend notifications**: Configure alerts when spending reaches certain thresholds

#### Archive a workspace

To archive a workspace, click the ellipsis menu (**...**) and select **Archive**. Archiving:

- Preserves historical data for reporting
- Deactivates the workspace and all associated API keys
- Cannot be undone

<Warning>
Archiving a workspace immediately revokes all API keys in that workspace. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### Via the Admin API

Programmatically manage workspaces using the [Admin API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/administration-api).

<Note>
Admin API endpoints require an Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin...`) that differs from standard API keys. Only organization members with the admin role can provision Admin API keys through the [Claude Console](/settings/admin-keys).
</Note>

```bash
# Create a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"name": "Production"}'

# List workspaces
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces?limit=10&include_archived=false" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Archive a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/archive" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see the [Workspaces API reference](/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspaces/get-workspace).

### Managing workspace members

Add, update, or remove members from a workspace:

```bash
# Add a member to a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "user_xxx",
    "workspace_role": "workspace_developer"
  }'

# Update a member's role
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"workspace_role": "workspace_admin"}'

# Remove a member from a workspace
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

For complete parameter details, see the [Workspace Members API reference](/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspace_members/get-workspace-member).

## API keys and resource scoping

API keys are scoped to a specific workspace. When you create an API key in a workspace, it can only access resources within that workspace.

Resources scoped to workspaces include:
- **Files** created via the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files)
- **Message Batches** created via the [Batch API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)
- **Skills** created via the [Skills API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide)

<Note>
Starting February 5, 2026, [prompt caches](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) will also be isolated per workspace (applies to the Claude API and Azure only).
</Note>

<Tip>
To retrieve your organization's workspace IDs, use the [List Workspaces](/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspaces/list-workspaces) endpoint, or find them in the [Claude Console](/settings/workspaces).
</Tip>

## Workspace limits

You can set custom spend and rate limits for each workspace to protect against overuse and ensure fair resource distribution.

### Setting workspace limits

Workspace limits can be set lower than (but not higher than) your organization's limits:

- **Spend limits**: Cap monthly spending for a workspace
- **Rate limits**: Limit requests per minute, input tokens per minute, or output tokens per minute

<Note>
- You cannot set limits on the Default Workspace
- If not set, workspace limits match the organization's limits
- Organization-wide limits always apply, even if workspace limits add up to more
</Note>

For detailed information on rate limits and how they work, see [Rate limits](/docs/en/api/rate-limits).

## Usage and cost tracking

Track usage and costs by workspace using the [Usage and Cost API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api):

```bash
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages?\
starting_at=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&\
ending_at=2025-01-08T00:00:00Z&\
workspace_ids[]=wrkspc_01JwQvzr7rXLA5AGx3HKfFUJ&\
group_by[]=workspace_id&\
bucket_width=1d" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Usage and costs attributed to the Default Workspace have a `null` value for `workspace_id`.

## Common use cases

### Environment separation

Create separate workspaces for development, staging, and production:

| Workspace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Development | Testing and experimentation with lower rate limits |
| Staging | Pre-production testing with production-like limits |
| Production | Live traffic with full rate limits and monitoring |

### Team or department isolation

Assign workspaces to different teams for cost allocation and access control:

- **Engineering team** with developer access
- **Data science team** with their own API keys
- **Support team** with limited access for customer tools

### Project-based organization

Create workspaces for specific projects or products to track usage and costs separately.

## Best practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan your workspace structure">
    Consider how you'll organize workspaces before creating them. Think about billing, access control, and usage tracking needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use meaningful names">
    Name workspaces clearly to indicate their purpose (e.g., "Production - Customer Chatbot", "Dev - Internal Tools").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set appropriate limits">
    Configure spend and rate limits to prevent unexpected costs and ensure fair resource distribution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Audit access regularly">
    Review workspace membership periodically to ensure only appropriate users have access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor usage">
    Use the [Usage and Cost API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api) to track workspace-level consumption.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ

<section title="What's the Default Workspace?">

Every organization has a "Default Workspace" that cannot be edited, renamed, or removed. This workspace has no ID and doesn't appear in workspace list endpoints. Usage attributed to the Default Workspace shows a `null` value for `workspace_id` in API responses.

</section>

<section title="Are there limits on workspaces?">

Yes, you can have a maximum of 100 workspaces per organization. Archived workspaces do not count towards this limit.

</section>

<section title="How do organization roles affect workspace access?">

Organization admins automatically get the Workspace Admin role in all workspaces. Organization billing members automatically get the Workspace Billing role. Organization users and developers must be manually added to each workspace.

</section>

<section title="Which roles can be assigned in workspaces?">

Organization users and developers can be assigned Workspace Admin, Workspace Developer, or Workspace User roles. The Workspace Billing role cannot be manually assigned; it's inherited from having the organization `billing` role.

</section>

<section title="Can organization admin or billing members' workspace roles be changed?">

Only organization billing members can have their workspace role upgraded to an admin role. Otherwise, organization admins and billing members cannot have their workspace roles changed or be removed from workspaces while they hold those organization roles. Their workspace access must be modified by changing their organization role first.

</section>

<section title="What happens to workspace access when organization roles change?">

If an organization admin or billing member is demoted to user or developer, they lose access to all workspaces except ones where they were manually assigned roles. When users are promoted to admin or billing roles, they gain automatic access to all workspaces.

</section>

<section title="What happens to API keys when a user is removed from a workspace?">

API keys persist in their current state as they are scoped to the organization and workspace, not to individual users.
