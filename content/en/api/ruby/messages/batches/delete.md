# Delete a Message Batch

`messages.batches.delete(message_batch_id, **kwargs) -> DeletedMessageBatch`

**DELETE** `/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}`

Delete a Message Batch.

Message Batches can only be deleted once they've finished processing. If you'd like to delete an in-progress batch, you must first cancel it.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

## Parameters

- `message_batch_id: String`

  ID of the Message Batch.

- `workspace_id: String`

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

## Returns

- `class DeletedMessageBatch`

  - `type: :message_batch_deleted`

    Deleted object type.

    For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch_deleted"`.

  - `id: String`

    ID of the Message Batch.

## Example

```ruby
require "anthropic"

anthropic = Anthropic::Client.new(api_key: "my-anthropic-api-key")

deleted_message_batch = anthropic.messages.batches.delete("message_batch_id")

puts(deleted_message_batch)
```

### Response (200)

```json
{
  "id": "msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF",
  "type": "message_batch_deleted"
}
```
