# List Tunnels

`$ ant beta:tunnels list`

**GET** `/v1/tunnels`

The Tunnels API is in research preview. It requires the `anthropic-beta: mcp-tunnels-2026-06-22` header and may change without a deprecation period. It supersedes the Admin API endpoints at `/v1/organizations/tunnels`, which remain available during a migration window.

Lists tunnels. Results are ordered by creation time, newest first; archived tunnels are excluded unless include_archived is set.

## Parameters

- `--include-archived: optional boolean`

  Query param: Whether to include archived tunnels in the results. Defaults to false.

- `--limit: optional number`

  Query param: Maximum number of tunnels to return per page. Defaults to 20, maximum 1000.

  format: int32

- `--page: optional string`

  Query param: Opaque pagination cursor from a previous `list_tunnels` response.

- `--beta: optional array of AnthropicBeta`

  Header param: Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

- `--workspace-id: optional string`

  Header param: Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

## Returns

- `BetaListTunnelsResponse: object`

  A paginated list of tunnels.

  - `data: array of BetaTunnel`

    List of tunnels, ordered by created_at descending.

    - `type: "tunnel"`

    - `id: string`

      Unique identifier for the tunnel, prefixed with `tnl_`.

    - `archived_at: string`

      A timestamp in RFC 3339 format

      format: date-time

    - `created_at: string`

      A timestamp in RFC 3339 format

      format: date-time

    - `display_name: string`

      Human-readable name for the tunnel (1-255 characters). Null if unset.

    - `domain: string`

      Anthropic-assigned hostname for the tunnel. MCP server URLs whose host is a subdomain of this value are routed through the tunnel. Globally unique and never reused, even after the tunnel is archived.

  - `next_page: string`

    Pagination cursor for the next page, or null if no more results.

## Example

```bash
ant beta:tunnels list \
  --api-key my-anthropic-api-key
```
