# Archive a Memory Store

`$ ant beta:memory-stores archive`

**POST** `/v1/memory_stores/{memory_store_id}/archive`

Archive a Memory Store

## Parameters

- `--memory-store-id: string` (path parameter)

  The ID of the memory store to archive (`memstore_...`).

  Archiving can't be undone. Archiving a store that is already archived returns it unchanged.

- `--beta: optional array of AnthropicBeta` (header parameter)

  This endpoint is in beta: requests must send `agent-memory-2026-07-22` or `managed-agents-2026-04-01` in this header.

- `--workspace-id: optional string` (header parameter)

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

## Returns

- `beta_managed_agents_memory_store: object`

  A `memory_store`: a named container for agent memories, scoped to a workspace. Attach a store to a session via `resources[]` to mount it as a directory the agent can read and write.

  - `type: "memory_store"`

  - `id: string`

    The unique ID of the memory store (`memstore_...`). Use it to attach the store to a session.

  - `archived_at: string`

    When the memory store was archived, in RFC 3339, or `null` if it hasn't been.

    Archiving can't be undone. An archived store can't be attached to new sessions. You can't create or update its memories or update the store. You can still read and delete its memories, redact their versions, and delete the store.

    See the [memory guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/memory?sdk_languages=cli#archive-a-store) to learn more about archiving.

    format: date-time

  - `created_at: string`

    When the memory store was created, in RFC 3339.

    format: date-time

  - `description: string`

    Free-text description of what the store contains, up to 1,024 characters. Included in the agent's system prompt when the store is attached, so word it to be useful to the agent. Empty string when unset.

  - `metadata: map[string]`

    Key-value pairs for your own use, such as the end user that the store belongs to.

    A store has at most 16 pairs. Keys are 1 to 64 characters long and values at most 512 characters. You can't filter lists by metadata.

  - `name: string`

    Human-readable name for the store. 1–255 characters. The store's mount-path slug under `/mnt/memory/` is derived from this name.

  - `updated_at: string`

    When the memory store was last changed, in RFC 3339.

    Changing its `name`, `description`, or `metadata` updates it. Archiving the store does too. Changes to the store's memories don't.
