# Create Plugin Version

**POST** `/v1/organizations/plugins/{plugin_id}/versions`

Add a version to an organization-owned Plugin by uploading the new version's
files; it becomes the version served to members unless the Plugin's served version
has been pinned.

The upload is the same `multipart/form-data` as creating a Plugin: the version's
files (`files`, each part sent as `files[]`) and optional `release_notes`. The uploaded manifest's `name`
must equal the Plugin's `name`. Returns the stored version; read the Plugin back to
see which version it serves.

Only a Plugin in a `manual` marketplace takes uploads; a Plugin synchronized from
a repository gets its versions from the repository. When the Plugin is in the
organization's library marketplace, a version that adds a skill with the name of an
organization skill (a skill an administrator uploaded for the whole organization in
claude.ai) is refused with a 409: `error_code` `skill_name_taken`, with that name in
`details.skill_name`. A 503 with `error_code`
`registration_pending` means the version was stored but is not yet usable; a later
version create on the Plugin completes it.

For a worked example, see [Create a version](/docs/en/manage-claude/plugins-api#create-a-version)
in the Plugins API guide.

**Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `write:plugins` scope.

Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.

## Path parameters

  ID of the Plugin (prefixed `plugin_`).

## Body parameters (form-data)

- `files: array of string`

  The version's files: one part per file, the part's filename being the file's path within the Plugin (for example `skills/review-pr/SKILL.md`), or a single `.zip` or `.plugin` archive holding them all. On the wire each part is named `files[]`, and a part named plain `files` is not read; with cURL, `-F 'files[]=@SKILL.md;filename=skills/review-pr/SKILL.md'`. The files must include the manifest, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

- `release_notes: optional string`

  Release notes stored with the version and shown in its version history in claude.ai; up to 5,000 characters.

  maxLength: 5000

## Returns

- `BetaPluginVersion object`

  - `type: "plugin_version"`

    Always `plugin_version`.

    default: plugin_version

  - `id: string`

    The version's ID.

  - `components: array of BetaPluginComponent or null`

    What the version contains; null when not enumerated.

    - `type: "agent" or "cli" or "command" or 3 more`

    - `description: string or null`

      What the component declares about itself; always null for MCP servers, hooks, and CLIs.

    - `name: string`

      The component's name: a skill's, command's or agent's name, an MCP server's key in the manifest, the event a hook runs on, or a CLI's executable.

  - `content_scan: BetaPluginContentScan or null`

    This version's content scan; null when it has not been scanned.

    - `assessment: "fail" or "pass" or "unknown" or "warn" or null`
