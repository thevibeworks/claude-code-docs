# Delete RBAC Group

**DELETE** `/v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{group_id}`

Delete an RBAC Group. Groups provisioned by an identity provider (source type `"scim"`) cannot be deleted via the API while an organization in the tenant uses SCIM provisioning.

The RBAC Groups API is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only.

## Path parameters

- `group_id: string`

  ID of the RBAC Group.

## Returns

- `BetaRBACGroupDeleted object`

  - `type: "rbac_group_deleted"`

    Deleted object type.

    For RBAC Groups, this is always `"rbac_group_deleted"`.

    default: rbac_group_deleted

  - `id: string`

    ID of the RBAC Group.
