# Record Heartbeat

- Signature: `client.beta.environments.work.heartbeat(workID: string, params: WorkHeartbeatParams, options?: RequestOptions): BetaSelfHostedWorkHeartbeatResponse`
- Endpoint: `POST /v1/environments/{environment_id}/work/{work_id}/heartbeat`

Note: these endpoints are called automatically by the pre-built environment worker provided in the SDKs and CLI, for orchestrating sessions with self-hosted sandbox environments. They are included here as a reference; you do not need to invoke them directly.

Record a heartbeat for a work item to maintain the lease.

## Example request

```ts
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] // This is the default and can be omitted
});

const betaSelfHostedWorkHeartbeatResponse = await client.beta.environments.work.heartbeat(
  "work_id",
  { environment_id: "env_011CZkZ9X2dpNyB7HsEFoRfW" }
);

console.log(betaSelfHostedWorkHeartbeatResponse.last_heartbeat);
```

## Example response (200)

```json
{
  "last_heartbeat": "last_heartbeat",
  "lease_extended": true,
  "state": "queued",
  "ttl_seconds": 0,
  "type": "work_heartbeat"
}
```

## Parameters

```ts
workID: string; // path parameter

interface WorkHeartbeatParams {
  environment_id: string; // path parameter
  /** Desired TTL in seconds */
  desired_ttl_seconds?: number | null; // query parameter
  /** Expected last_heartbeat for conditional update (optimistic concurrency). Use literal 'NO_HEARTBEAT' to claim an unclaimed lease (first heartbeat). For subsequent heartbeats, echo the server's previous last_heartbeat value exactly. Returns 412 Precondition Failed if the actual value doesn't match. The server does not compare the value when the work item is 'stopping' or 'stopped'. */
  expected_last_heartbeat?: string | null; // query parameter
  /** Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use. */
  betas?: Array<AnthropicBeta>; // header parameter
}
```

## Returns

```ts
/** Response after recording a heartbeat for a work item. */
interface BetaSelfHostedWorkHeartbeatResponse {
  /** The type of response */
  type: "work_heartbeat";
  /** RFC 3339 timestamp of the most recent heartbeat recorded for this work item, or an empty string if none has been recorded */
  last_heartbeat: string;
  /** Whether the heartbeat succeeded in extending the lease */
  lease_extended: boolean;
  /** Current state of the work item (active/stopping/stopped) */
  state: "queued" | "starting" | "active" | "stopping" | "stopped";
  /** Effective TTL applied to the lease */
  ttl_seconds: number;
}
```

## Errors

Any method can also return the general [HTTP errors](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/errors?sdk_languages=typescript).

- `BetaHeartbeatPreconditionFailedError` (HTTP status 412, error code `heartbeat_precondition_failed`)

  `expected_last_heartbeat` does not match the stored heartbeat, so another worker may hold the lease.
