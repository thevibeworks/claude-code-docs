# Create a Message

`client.beta.messages.create(params, options?): BetaMessage | Stream<BetaRawMessageStreamEvent>`

**POST** `/v1/messages`

Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model will generate the next message in the conversation.

The Messages API can be used for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.

Learn more about the Messages API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/get-started)

## Parameters

- `MessageCreateParams = MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming | MessageCreateParamsStreaming`

  - `MessageCreateParamsBase`

    - `max_tokens: number`

      Body param: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

      Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

      Set to `0` to populate the [prompt cache](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#pre-warming-the-cache) without generating a response.

      Different models have different maximum values for this parameter.  See [models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) for details.

      minimum: 0

    - `messages: Array<BetaMessageParam>`

      Body param: Input messages.

      Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

      Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

      If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

      Example with a single `user` message:

      ```json
      [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
      ```

      Example with multiple conversational turns:

      ```json
      [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
      ]
      ```

      Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

      ```json
      [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
      ]
      ```

      Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

      ```json
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
      ```

      ```json
      {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
      ```

      See [input examples](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages).

      Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

      There is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request.

            - `transformations?: BetaImageTransformationsParam | null`

              Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied. Omitted keys keep their default behavior, and an empty object is equivalent to omitting the field.

              - `oversized_image?: "downsize" | "error"`

                What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

              Thinking blocks must be passed back unmodified and in their original order; a modified block results in a 400 `invalid_request_error`.

                - `BetaBrowserStateBlockParam`

                  The caller's browser state after a browser toolset member call —
                  the full inventory of open tabs, which tab is active, and any side
                  effects (tabs opened, download state changes) the call produced.

                  At most one per `tool_result`, only on a non-error result answering a
                  browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
                  model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.

                  - `tabs: Array<BetaBrowserStateTabEntry>`

                    All tabs open in the browser after this call — the full inventory, not a delta. May be empty. Whenever non-empty, exactly one entry carries `active: true`.

                    maxItems: 100

                    - `tab_id: string`

                    - `active?: boolean`

                      Whether this tab is the active tab after this call. Whenever `tabs` is non-empty, exactly one entry is marked `active: true`.

                    maxItems: 200, minItems: 1

                    - `BetaBrowserStateChangeTabOpened`

                      A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —
                      the creation delta of the `tabs` inventory, not an event log.

                      Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its

            A `fallback` block echoed back from a prior response.

            Accepted in `messages[].content` and not rendered into the prompt; not
            validated against the request's `fallbacks` chain or top-level `model`.

            Echo the assistant turn back verbatim, including this block in its
            original position. The block marks the boundary between content produced
            before and after a fallback hop, and the server relies on that boundary
            to validate the turn: when thinking runs flank the boundary, omitting
            the block merges them into one span the server cannot validate (the
            request is rejected), and moving it into the middle of a single run is
            likewise rejected; between non-thinking blocks the block's placement has
            no validation effect.

      Body param: Request-level diagnostics. Currently carries the previous response
      id for prompt-cache divergence reporting.

      - `previous_message_id?: string | null`

        The `id` (`msg_...`) from this client's previous /v1/messages response. The server compares that request's prompt fingerprint against this one and returns `diagnostics.cache_miss_reason` when the prompt-cache prefix could not be reused. Pass `null` on the first turn to opt in without a prior message to compare.

        maxLength: 256

    - `fallback_credit_token?: string | BetaFallbackCreditTokenParam | null`

      Body param: The `fallback_credit_token` from a prior refusal's `stop_details`.

      When a preceding request was refused and returned a `fallback_credit_token`,
      pass that code here on the retry to have the retry's cache-creation tokens
      for the prefix that was warm on the refused model billed at the cache-read
      rate. Must be redeemed by the same organization and workspace, with the same
      request body (optionally extended by one appended `assistant` message whose
      content is the partial text — with any trailing whitespace stripped from
      the final text block — and paired server-tool blocks streamed before the
      refusal; the appended-assistant form is not available for requests with
      `output_format` set or forced `tool_choice`), on an eligible fallback
      model, on the same platform,
      and within 5 minutes of the refusal; a mismatch is a 400. A token minted
      mid-server-tool-loop whose partial content was continuable may only be
      redeemed with the appended-assistant form — if an exact-body retry is
      rejected with a 400 saying the token must be redeemed by continuing the
      partial response, retry with the appended-assistant form instead.

      When the appended-assistant form is used on a model that otherwise disallows
      assistant-turn prefill, this token also authorizes that one prefill.

      - `string`

      - `BetaFallbackCreditTokenParam`

        Object form of `fallback_credit_token`: the token plus a redemption
        mode.

        Requires `anthropic-beta: fallback-credit-2026-07-01`; without that
        header the field accepts the bare string only. The bare string and the
        mode-less object are equivalent (both select `strict`), so wrapping
        an existing token changes nothing by itself.

        - `token: string`

          The opaque `fallback_credit_token` from a prior refusal's `stop_details` — the same string the bare-string form carries.

          maxLength: 2048, minLength: 1

        - `mode?: "strict" | "best_effort"`

          How a failing token affects the retry. `strict` (the default, and the bare-string behavior): a failing redemption is a 400 and the retry is not served. `best_effort`: the retry is served either way — a token-layer failure no longer rejects the request; the retry proceeds at normal price and the outcome is reported on the response's `usage.fallback_credit`. Two failures stay hard in both modes: a malformed token, and combining `fallback_credit_token` with `fallbacks`.

          - `"strict"`

          - `"best_effort"`

    - `fallbacks?: BetaFallbacksParam | null`

      Body param: Opt-in server-side retry on one or more substitute models when the requested model declines for policy reasons. Tried in order: if the first entry also declines, the second is tried, and so on. The string "default" requests the requested model's server-defined default fallback configuration.

      - `Array<BetaFallbackParam>`

              minimum: 1024

            - `type: "tokens"`

              The budget type. Currently only 'tokens' is supported.

            - `remaining?: number | null`

              Remaining tokens in the budget. Use this to track usage across contexts when implementing compaction client-side. Defaults to total if not provided.

              minimum: 0

        - `speed?: "standard" | "fast" | null`

          Inference speed mode. `fast` provides significantly faster output token generation at premium pricing. Not all models support `fast`; invalid combinations are rejected at create time.

          - `"standard"`

          - `"fast"`

        - `thinking?: BetaThinkingConfigEnabled | BetaThinkingConfigDisabled | BetaThinkingConfigAdaptive | null`

          - `BetaThinkingConfigEnabled`

            - `budget_tokens: number`

              Determines how many tokens Claude can use for its internal reasoning process. Larger budgets can enable more thorough analysis for complex problems, improving response quality.

              Must be ≥1024 and less than `max_tokens`.

      Body param: Determines whether to use priority capacity (if available) or standard capacity for this request.

      Anthropic offers different levels of service for your API requests. See [service-tiers](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/service-tiers) for details.

      - `"auto"`

      - `"standard_only"`

    - `speed?: "standard" | "fast" | null`

      Body param: Inference speed mode. `fast` provides significantly faster output token generation at premium pricing. Not all models support `fast`; invalid combinations are rejected at create time.

      - `"standard"`

      - `"fast"`

    - `stop_sequences?: Array<string>`

      Body param: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

      Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn, which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

      If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"` and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the model will output exactly one tool use.

      - `BetaToolChoiceNone`

        The model will not be allowed to use tools.

        - `type: "none"`

    - `tools?: Array<BetaToolUnion>`

      Body param: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

      If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

      There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).

      Each tool definition includes:

      * `name`: Name of the tool.
      * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
      * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

      For example, if you defined `tools` as:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "name": "get_stock_price",
          "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
          "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "ticker": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
              }
            },
            "required": ["ticker"]
          }
        }
      ]
      ```

      And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "type": "tool_use",
          "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
          "name": "get_stock_price",
          "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
        }
      ]
      ```

      You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "type": "tool_result",
          "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
          "content": "259.75 USD"
        }
      ]
      ```

      Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

      See our [guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) for more details.

        - `description?: string`

          Description of what this tool does.

          Tool descriptions should be as detailed as possible. The more information that the model has about what the tool is and how to use it, the better it will perform. You can use natural language descriptions to reinforce important aspects of the tool input JSON schema.

        - `eager_input_streaming?: boolean | null`

          Enable eager input streaming for this tool. When true, tool input parameters will be streamed incrementally as they are generated, and types will be inferred on-the-fly rather than buffering the full JSON output. When false, streaming is disabled for this tool even if the fine-grained-tool-streaming beta is active. When null (default), uses the default behavior based on beta headers.

        - `caching?: BetaCacheControlEphemeral | null`

          Caching for the advisor's own prompt. When set, each advisor call writes a cache entry at the given TTL so subsequent calls in the same conversation read the stable prefix. When omitted, the advisor prompt is not cached.

        - `defer_loading?: boolean`

          If true, tool will not be included in initial system prompt. Only loaded when returned via tool_reference from tool search.

When the advisor hits this cap, the returned advisor_result or advisor_redacted_result block carries stop_reason='max_tokens', and a truncation note is appended to the advice text the worker model sees (inside the encrypted blob in redacted mode). When set, the server also emits a remaining-tokens budget block in the advisor's prompt so the advisor self-shapes toward the cap. When omitted, the advisor model's default output cap applies and no budget block is emitted.

      Body param: Deprecated: Use `output_config.format` instead. See [structured outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs)

      A schema to specify Claude's output format in responses. This parameter will be removed in a future release.

    - `temperature?: number`

      **Deprecated**: Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not support setting temperature. A value of 1.0 of will be accepted for backwards compatibility, all other values will be rejected with a 400 error.

      Body param: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

      Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

      Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

      maximum: 1, minimum: 0

    - `top_k?: number`

      **Deprecated**: Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not accept top_k; any value will be rejected with a 400 error.

      Body param: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

      Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

      Recommended for advanced use cases only.

## Returns

- `BetaMessage`

  - `id: string`

    Unique object identifier.

    The format and length of IDs may change over time.

  - `container: BetaContainer | null`

    Information about the container used in the request (for the code execution tool)

    - `id: string`

      Identifier for the container used in this request

    - `expires_at: string`

      The time at which the container will expire.

      format: date-time

    - `skills: Array<BetaContainerSkill> | null`

      Skills loaded in the container

      - `skill_id: string`

        maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

      - `type: "anthropic" | "custom"`

        Type of skill - either 'anthropic' (built-in) or 'custom' (user-defined)

        - `"anthropic"`

        - `"custom"`

      - `version: string`

        The resolved version: a skill version ID for custom skills.

        maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

  - `content: Array<BetaContentBlock>`

    Content generated by the model.

    This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

    Example:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
    ```

    If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

    For example, if the input `messages` were:

    ```json
    [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
    ]

    Then the response `content` might be:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
    ```

    - `BetaTextBlock`

      - `citations: Array<BetaTextCitation> | null`

    - `BetaCompactionBlock`

      A compaction block returned when autocompact is triggered.

      compaction blocks with null content; the server treats them as no-ops.

      - `content: string | null`

        Summary of compacted content, or null if compaction failed

      - `encrypted_content: string | null`

        Opaque metadata from prior compaction, to be round-tripped verbatim

      - `type: "compaction"`

        default: compaction

    - `BetaFallbackBlock`

      Marks the point in `content` where one model's output gives way to the next.

      One block appears per hop where a preceding model actually ran this turn and
      declined. A turn where no preceding model ran and declined has no such
      boundary and carries no block — the signal for whether a fallback model
      served the response is the presence of a `fallback_message` entry in
      `usage.iterations`, not this block.

      The block is treated like a server-tool content block for streaming: it
      arrives via the standard `content_block_start` / `content_block_stop`
      pair and carries no deltas.

      - `from: BetaFallbackInfo`

        The model whose output ends at this point — the model that declined at this hop. When the declining hop is the requested model, its `model` echoes the top-level `model` string the caller sent (alias or canonical); when the declining hop is a fallback model, its `model` is that model's canonical id.

        - `model: Model`

          The model that will complete your prompt.

  - `diagnostics: BetaDiagnostics | null`

    Response envelope for request-level diagnostics. Present (possibly
    null) whenever the caller supplied `diagnostics` on the request.

    - `cache_miss_reason: BetaCacheMissModelChanged | BetaCacheMissSystemChanged | BetaCacheMissToolsChanged | 3 more | null`

      Explains why the prompt cache could not fully reuse the prefix from the request identified by `diagnostics.previous_message_id`. `null` means diagnosis is still pending — the response was serialized before the background comparison completed.

    Structured information about a refusal.

    - `category: "cyber" | "bio" | "frontier_llm" | 2 more | null`

      - `bio` - The request could enable biological harm, such as dangerous lab methods. Beneficial life sciences work can also trigger this category.

      - `"general_harms"`

        The request could be related to an area that was determined as harmful. Benign work might sometimes trigger this category.

    - `explanation: string | null`

      Human-readable explanation of the refusal.

      This text is not guaranteed to be stable. `null` when no explanation is available for the category.

    - `fallback_credit_token: string | null`

      Opaque code that refunds the cache-miss cost when retrying this refused
      request on the fallback model. Pass it as `fallback_credit_token` on the
      retry request. Expires 5 minutes after the refusal.

      The retry is sent either with the same request body (`system`, `messages`,
      `tools`, and other render-shaping fields), or with the same body plus one
      appended `assistant` message whose content is the partial text (with any
      trailing whitespace stripped from the final text block) and paired
      server-tool blocks from this refusal — which also authorizes that
      appended turn as an assistant-prefill continuation on models that otherwise
      disallow prefill. A token minted mid-server-tool-loop whose partial content
      was continuable may only be redeemed the second way — if a same-body retry
      is rejected with a 400 saying the token must be redeemed by continuing the
      partial response, retry the second way instead. Either way: same workspace,
      same platform; a mismatch is a 400. Resending a token for an already-warm
      prefix is permitted but yields no additional credit.

      `null` when the refused model isn't eligible for a fallback credit.

    - `fallback_has_prefill_claim: boolean | null`

      Whether the accompanying `fallback_credit_token` may be redeemed with the
      appended-assistant retry form. Only set when `fallback_credit_token` is
      present.

      `true`: retry by resending the same request body plus one appended
      `assistant` message whose content is this response's `content` with any
      trailing whitespace stripped from the final text block and unpaired
      `tool_use` blocks omitted (the same appended-turn shape described on
      `fallback_credit_token`), with the token attached. `false`: retry by
      resending the original request body unchanged, with the token attached —
      the appended-assistant form is not available for this refusal (no
      continuable partial content, or the request uses `output_format` or a
      `tool_choice` that forces tool use). One exception: when the request used
      `output_format` or a forced `tool_choice` and the refusal arrived after
      server tools (including MCP connector tools) had already executed, the
      token may not be redeemable by either retry form; if the exact-body retry
      is then rejected with a 400 saying the token must be redeemed by
      continuing the partial response, discard the token and retry without it.

      Advisory: if an appended-assistant retry is rejected with a 400 despite
      `true`, fall back to resending the original request body with the token.

    - `recommended_model: string | null`

      The server's suggested retry target for this refusal. Populated when a fallback attempt could not be made (the fallback model's rate limit was exhausted, or it was overloaded); names the fallback model the caller can retry directly. Null otherwise.

    - `type: "refusal"`

      default: refusal

  - `stop_reason: BetaStopReason | null`

    The reason that we stopped.

    This may be one the following values:

    * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point
    * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens` or the model's maximum
    * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
    * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools
    * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let the model continue.
    * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations
    * `"model_context_window_exceeded"`: we exceeded the model's context window

    In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event and non-null otherwise.

    - `"end_turn"`

    - `"max_tokens"`

    - `"stop_sequence"`

    - `"tool_use"`

    - `"pause_turn"`

    - `"compaction"`

    - `"refusal"`

    - `"model_context_window_exceeded"`

  - `stop_sequence: string | null`

    Which custom stop sequence was generated, if any.

    This value will be a non-null string if one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

  - `type: "message"`

    Object type.

    For Messages, this is always `"message"`.

    default: message

  - `usage: BetaUsage`

    Billing and rate-limit usage.

    Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

    Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

    For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

    Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

    - `cache_creation: BetaCacheCreation | null`

      Breakdown of cached tokens by TTL

      - `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens: number`

    - `cache_read_input_tokens: number | null`

      The number of input tokens read from the cache.

      minimum: 0

    - `fallback_credit: BetaFallbackCreditUsage | null`

      Outcome of the `fallback_credit_token` presented on this request.

      - `status: BetaFallbackCreditRedeemed | BetaFallbackCreditNotApplied`

        Whether the fallback-credit reprice was applied to this response's billing.

        A union discriminated on `type`. `redeemed`: the retry is billed as if
        the conversation had been on the retry model all along — including when the
        resulting shift is zero because there was nothing to move. `not_applied`:
        no reprice was applied; the arm's `reason` says why.

        - `BetaFallbackCreditRedeemed`

          The reprice was applied: the retry is billed as if the conversation
          had been on the retry model all along.

          - `type: "redeemed"`

            default: redeemed

        - `BetaFallbackCreditNotApplied`

          No reprice was applied; `reason` says why.

          - `reason: "body_mismatch" | "continuation_excluded" | "continuation_only" | 9 more`

            Why the reprice was not applied.

            A closed enum; additions to the redemption-check vocabulary arrive as
            deliberate schema updates.

            - `"body_mismatch"`

            - `"continuation_excluded"`

            - `"continuation_only"`

            - `"expired"`

            - `"invalid_target_model"`

            - `"not_enabled"`

            - `"reprice_unavailable"`

            - `"temporarily_unavailable"`

            - `"variant_fields_present"`

            - `"wrong_organization"`

            - `"wrong_platform"`

            - `"wrong_workspace"`

          - `type: "not_applied"`

            default: not_applied

          - `remove_to_redeem?: Array<string> | null`

            Request fields to remove before retrying, so the retry can redeem this
            token.

            Present exactly when `reason` is `variant_fields_present` — never null,
            never an empty array; absent otherwise. Fields are named only from your own request, and only after
            the sealed variant hash matched. A served best-effort retry has already
            been billed at normal price; nothing redeems retroactively, but a corrected
            re-send inside the token's five-minute window can still redeem.

    - `inference_geo: string | null`

      The geographic region where inference was performed for this request.

    - `input_tokens: number`

      The number of input tokens which were used.

      minimum: 0

    - `iterations: BetaIterationsUsage | null`

      Per-iteration token usage breakdown.

      Each entry represents one sampling iteration, with its own input/output token counts and cache statistics, discriminated by `type`. For `message` entries (model sampling iterations, such as the turns of a server-side tool use loop), this allows you to:

      - Determine which iterations exceeded long context thresholds (>=200k tokens)
      - Calculate the context window size from the last `message` entry
      - Understand token accumulation across server-side tool use loops

      A `compaction` entry reports the token usage of the compaction operation itself — the server-side request that summarizes the context being closed — NOT the size of the context that was compacted away, and its token counts can be much smaller than that closed context (for example, a compaction that closes a ~200k-token context can report only a few thousand tokens). Do not derive the context window size from a `compaction` entry, even when it is the last entry. A `compaction` entry's tokens are not included in the top-level `usage` fields. When an input-token trigger is in effect (the default — 150,000 tokens unless configured otherwise), each `compaction` entry closes a context that had reached at least that threshold, though the context can exceed it by the final iteration's output and tool results.

      - `BetaMessageIterationUsage`

        Token usage for a sampling iteration.

      - `BetaFallbackMessageIterationUsage`

        Token usage for the fallback-model attempt of a server-side fallback request.

        Produced in place of a `message` entry for whichever hop served the
        response. A declined hop produces the existing `message` entry. Whether
        a fallback model served the response is signalled by the presence of this

    - `output_tokens_details: BetaOutputTokensDetails | null`

      Breakdown of output tokens by category.

      `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
      This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
      how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
      have been summarized before being returned to you.

      - `thinking_tokens: number`

        Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
        the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

        Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
        summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
        re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
        generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
        `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

    - `usage: BetaMessageDeltaUsage`

      Billing and rate-limit usage.

      Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

      Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

      For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

      Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

      - `cache_creation_input_tokens: number | null`

        The cumulative number of input tokens used to create the cache entry.

        minimum: 0

      - `cache_read_input_tokens: number | null`

        The cumulative number of input tokens read from the cache.

        minimum: 0

      - `fallback_credit: BetaFallbackCreditUsage | null`

        Outcome of the `fallback_credit_token` presented on this request.

      - `input_tokens: number | null`

        The cumulative number of input tokens which were used.

        minimum: 0

      - `iterations: BetaIterationsUsage | null`

        Per-iteration token usage breakdown.

        Each entry represents one sampling iteration, with its own input/output token counts and cache statistics, discriminated by `type`. For `message` entries (model sampling iterations, such as the turns of a server-side tool use loop), this allows you to:

        - Determine which iterations exceeded long context thresholds (>=200k tokens)
        - Calculate the context window size from the last `message` entry
        - Understand token accumulation across server-side tool use loops

        A `compaction` entry reports the token usage of the compaction operation itself — the server-side request that summarizes the context being closed — NOT the size of the context that was compacted away, and its token counts can be much smaller than that closed context (for example, a compaction that closes a ~200k-token context can report only a few thousand tokens). Do not derive the context window size from a `compaction` entry, even when it is the last entry. A `compaction` entry's tokens are not included in the top-level `usage` fields. When an input-token trigger is in effect (the default — 150,000 tokens unless configured otherwise), each `compaction` entry closes a context that had reached at least that threshold, though the context can exceed it by the final iteration's output and tool results.

      - `output_tokens: number`

        The cumulative number of output tokens which were used.

      - `output_tokens_details: BetaOutputTokensDetails | null`

        Breakdown of output tokens by category.

        `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
        This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
        how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
        have been summarized before being returned to you.

      - `server_tool_use: BetaServerToolUsage | null`

        The number of server tool requests.

  - `BetaRawMessageStopEvent`

    - `type: "message_stop"`

      default: message_stop

  - `BetaRawContentBlockStartEvent`

    - `content_block: BetaTextBlock | BetaThinkingBlock | BetaRedactedThinkingBlock | 14 more`

      Response model for a file uploaded to the container.

      - `BetaTextBlock`

      - `BetaThinkingBlock`

      - `BetaRedactedThinkingBlock`

      - `BetaToolUseBlock`

      - `BetaServerToolUseBlock`

      - `BetaToolSearchToolResultBlock`

      - `BetaMCPToolUseBlock`

      - `BetaMCPToolResultBlock`

      - `BetaContainerUploadBlock`

        Response model for a file uploaded to the container.

      - `BetaCompactionBlock`

        A compaction block returned when autocompact is triggered.

        When content is None, it indicates the compaction failed to produce a valid
        summary (e.g., malformed output from the model). Clients may round-trip
        compaction blocks with null content; the server treats them as no-ops.

      - `BetaFallbackBlock`

        Marks the point in `content` where one model's output gives way to the next.

        One block appears per hop where a preceding model actually ran this turn and
        declined. A turn where no preceding model ran and declined has no such
        boundary and carries no block — the signal for whether a fallback model
        served the response is the presence of a `fallback_message` entry in
        `usage.iterations`, not this block.

        The block is treated like a server-tool content block for streaming: it
        arrives via the standard `content_block_start` / `content_block_stop`
        pair and carries no deltas.

    - `index: number`

    - `type: "content_block_start"`

      default: content_block_start

  - `BetaRawContentBlockDeltaEvent`

    - `delta: BetaRawContentBlockDelta`

        - `type: "input_json_delta"`

          - `BetaCitationPageLocation`

          - `BetaCitationContentBlockLocation`

          - `BetaCitationsWebSearchResultLocation`

          - `BetaCitationSearchResultLocation`

        - `type: "citations_delta"`

          default: citations_delta

      - `BetaThinkingDelta`

        - `estimated_tokens: number | null`

          Per-frame increment of a coarse, running estimate of the tokens this thinking block has produced so far. Present whenever the `thinking-token-count-2026-05-13` beta is set; `null` unless `thinking.display` resolves to `"omitted"` and a count is due this frame. Sum the increments across `thinking_delta` frames on this block for a progress indicator. Each increment is a non-negative multiple of a fixed quantum and the cadence is rate-limited, so this is a deliberately lossy display hint, not a billable count; `usage.output_tokens` remains authoritative.

        - `thinking: string`

          The incremental `thinking` text for this content block. Concatenate the `thinking` values of successive `thinking_delta` events to assemble the block's full `thinking` value.

        - `type: "thinking_delta"`

          default: thinking_delta

      - `BetaSignatureDelta`

        - `signature: string`

          The `signature` for this thinking block: an opaque value used to verify that the block was generated by Claude when it is passed back to the API. Delivered in a `signature_delta` event just before the block's `content_block_stop` event.

        - `type: "signature_delta"`

          default: signature_delta

      - `BetaCompactionContentBlockDelta`

        - `content: string | null`

        - `encrypted_content: string | null`

          Opaque metadata from prior compaction, to be round-tripped verbatim

        - `type: "compaction_delta"`

          default: compaction_delta

    - `index: number`

    - `type: "content_block_delta"`

      default: content_block_delta

  - `BetaRawContentBlockStopEvent`

    - `index: number`

    - `type: "content_block_stop"`

      default: content_block_stop

## Example

```typescript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] // This is the default and can be omitted
});

const betaMessage = await client.beta.messages.create({
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [{ content: "Hello, world", role: "user" }],
  model: "claude-opus-5"
});

console.log(betaMessage.id);
