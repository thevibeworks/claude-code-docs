# Get Environment

`$client->beta->environments->retrieve(string environmentID, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas, ?string workspaceID): BetaEnvironment`

**GET** `/v1/environments/{environment_id}`

Retrieve a specific environment by ID.

## Parameters

- `environmentID: string` (path parameter)

- `betas?: optional list<AnthropicBeta>` (header parameter)

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

- `workspaceID?: optional string` (header parameter)

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

## Returns

- `class BetaEnvironment`

  - `"environment" type`

    The type of object (always 'environment')

  - `string id`

    Environment identifier (e.g., 'env_...')

  - `?string archivedAt`

    RFC 3339 timestamp when environment was archived, or null if not archived

  - `Config config`

    Environment configuration (either Anthropic Cloud or self-hosted)

  - `string createdAt`

    RFC 3339 timestamp when environment was created

  - `?string description`

    User-provided description for the environment; null when unset

  - `array<string,string> metadata`

    User-provided metadata key-value pairs

  - `string name`

    Human-readable name for the environment

  - `string updatedAt`

    RFC 3339 timestamp when environment was last updated

  - `?Scope scope`

    The visibility scope for this environment. 'organization' means visible to all accounts. 'account' means visible only to the owning account.

## Errors

Any method can also return the general [HTTP errors](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/errors?sdk_languages=php).

- `ClaudeCodeKeyCreatorNotMemberException` (HTTP status 400, error code `claude_code_key_creator_not_member`)

  The API key belongs to the Claude Code workspace, and the user who created it is no longer a member of the organization or of that workspace.

- `OrganizationOnHoldException` (HTTP status 400, error code `organization_on_hold`)

  Anthropic has disabled the organization for trust and safety reasons. An organization disabled for any other reason, such as billing, does not get this code. `appeal_url`, when present, is where the organization can appeal.

## Example

```php
<?php

require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Anthropic\Client;
use Anthropic\Beta\AnthropicBeta;

$client = new Client(apiKey: 'my-anthropic-api-key');

$betaEnvironment = $client->beta->environments->retrieve(
  'env_011CZkZ9X2dpNyB7HsEFoRfW',
  betas: [AnthropicBeta::COMPUTER_USE_2024_10_22],
  workspaceID: 'wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy',
);

var_dump($betaEnvironment);
```
