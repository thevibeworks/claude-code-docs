# Memory Stores

## Create a Memory Store

`$client->beta->memoryStores->create(string name, ?string description, ?array<string,string> metadata, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas, ?string workspaceID): BetaManagedAgentsMemoryStore`

**POST** `/v1/memory_stores`

Create a Memory Store

### Parameters

- `name: string`

  The name of the memory store, 1 to 255 characters long, without control characters. Names don't have to be unique in a workspace.

  In a session, the store's directory under `/mnt/memory/` is based on this name. The name is lowercased and every run of characters other than ASCII letters and digits becomes one hyphen. The session's memory store resource gives the exact path in `mount_path`.

  See the [memory guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/memory?sdk_languages=php#how-the-agent-accesses-memory) to learn more about how agents access memory stores.

- `description?:optional string`

  Free-text description of what the store contains, up to 1,024 characters. Included in the agent's system prompt when the store is attached, so word it to be useful to the agent.

- `metadata?:optional array<string,string>`

  Key-value pairs for your own use, such as the end user that the store belongs to. The agent doesn't see them.

  A store has at most 16 pairs. Keys are 1 to 64 characters long and values at most 512 characters.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>` (header parameter)

  This endpoint is in beta: requests must send `agent-memory-2026-07-22` or `managed-agents-2026-04-01` in this header.

- `workspaceID?:optional string` (header parameter)

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

### Returns

- `class BetaManagedAgentsMemoryStore`

  - `"memory_store" type`

  - `string id`

    The unique ID of the memory store (`memstore_...`). Use it to attach the store to a session.

  - `?\Datetime archivedAt`

    When the memory store was archived, in RFC 3339, or `null` if it hasn't been.

    Archiving can't be undone. An archived store can't be attached to new sessions. You can't create or update its memories or update the store. You can still read and delete its memories, redact their versions, and delete the store.

    See the [memory guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/memory?sdk_languages=php#archive-a-store) to learn more about archiving.

  - `\Datetime createdAt`

    When the memory store was created, in RFC 3339.

  - `string description`

    Free-text description of what the store contains, up to 1,024 characters. Included in the agent's system prompt when the store is attached, so word it to be useful to the agent. Empty string when unset.

  - `array<string,string> metadata`

    Key-value pairs for your own use, such as the end user that the store belongs to.

    A store has at most 16 pairs. Keys are 1 to 64 characters long and values at most 512 characters. You can't filter lists by metadata.

  - `string name`

    Human-readable name for the store. 1–255 characters. The store's mount-path slug under `/mnt/memory/` is derived from this name.

  - `\Datetime updatedAt`

    When the memory store was last changed, in RFC 3339.

    Changing its `name`, `description`, or `metadata` updates it. Archiving the store does too. Changes to the store's memories don't.

### Example

```php
<?php

require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Anthropic\Client;
use Anthropic\Beta\AnthropicBeta;

$client = new Client(apiKey: 'my-anthropic-api-key');

$betaManagedAgentsMemoryStore = $client->beta->memoryStores->create(

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

#### Returns

- `class ManagedAgentsMemory`

  - `"memory" type`

  - `string id`

    The unique ID of the memory (`mem_...`). It stays the same when the memory's path changes.

    To retrieve, update, or delete the memory, pass this ID.

  - `string contentSha256`

    Lowercase hex SHA-256 digest of the UTF-8 `content` bytes (64 characters). The server applies no normalization, so clients can compute the same hash locally for staleness checks and as the value for a `content_sha256` precondition on update. Always populated, regardless of `view`.

  - `int contentSizeBytes`

    The size of the memory's `content` in UTF-8 bytes. It is set regardless of `view`.

  - `\Datetime createdAt`

    When this memory was created, in RFC 3339 format.

  - `string memoryStoreID`

    ID of the memory store this memory belongs to (a `memstore_...` value).

  - `string memoryVersionID`

    The ID of the memory version that holds the memory's current content (`memver_...`).

    Memory versions don't have a flag that marks the latest one. Compare their IDs with this field instead.

    See the [memory guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/memory?sdk_languages=php#audit-memory-changes) to learn more about memory versions.

  - `string path`

    Hierarchical path of the memory within the store, e.g. `/projects/foo/notes.md`. Always starts with `/`. Paths are case-sensitive and unique within a store. Maximum 1,024 bytes.

  - `\Datetime updatedAt`

    When the memory was last changed, in RFC 3339.

    To find out who made the change, look at `created_by` on the memory version that `memory_version_id` references.

  - `?string content`

    The memory's UTF-8 text content, or `null` when the response uses `view=basic`.

    The maximum size is 100 kB (102,400 bytes).

  Return only memories whose path starts with this prefix, such as `/notes/`. This value appears in request URLs. Do not include secrets or personally identifiable information.

  Omit it to list the whole store. The prefix must end with `/` and matches whole segments, so `/notes/` matches `/notes/todo.md` but not `/notes-archive/todo.md`.

- `view?:optional ManagedAgentsMemoryView` (query parameter)

  Whether each memory in the response includes `content`. Defaults to `basic`, which sets it to `null`.

  With `full`, a page holds at most 20 items.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>` (header parameter)

  This endpoint is in beta: requests must send `agent-memory-2026-07-22` or `managed-agents-2026-04-01` in this header.

  With `view=full`, a page holds at most 20 versions.

- `memoryID?:optional string` (query parameter)

  Return only versions of the memory with this ID (`mem_...`).

  The filter still works after the memory is deleted. While that memory's versions are retained, the results include the version whose `operation` is `deleted`.

- `operation?:optional ManagedAgentsMemoryVersionOperation` (query parameter)

  Return only versions that record this kind of change.

- `page?:optional string` (query parameter)

  The `next_page` value from a previous response, to get the next page. Omit it to get the first page.

  Return only versions written by the session with this ID.

- `view?:optional ManagedAgentsMemoryView` (query parameter)

  Whether a `memory` or `memory_version` in the response includes its `content`. Defaults to `full` on retrieve operations and to `basic` on list, create, and update operations.

  With `full`, list operations return at most 20 items per page.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>` (header parameter)

  This endpoint is in beta: requests must send `agent-memory-2026-07-22` or `managed-agents-2026-04-01` in this header.

- `workspaceID?:optional string` (header parameter)

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

#### Returns

- `class ManagedAgentsMemoryVersion`

  - `"memory_version" type`

  - `string id`

    Unique identifier for this version (a `memver_...` value).

  - `\Datetime createdAt`

    When this version was written, in RFC 3339 format.

  - `string memoryID`

    The ID of the memory that this version belongs to (`mem_...`).

    The ID stays valid after the memory is deleted. Pass it as `memory_id` to [List Memory Versions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/list?sdk_languages=php) to get the memory's retained versions, including its `deleted` version while the lineage is retained.

  - `string memoryStoreID`

    ID of the memory store this version belongs to (a `memstore_...` value).

  - `ManagedAgentsMemoryVersionOperation operation`

    The kind of mutation this version records: `created`, `modified`, or `deleted`.

  - `?string content`

    The memory's UTF-8 text content as of this version. `null` when `view=basic`, when `operation` is `deleted`, or when `redacted_at` is set.

  - `?string contentSha256`

    Lowercase hex SHA-256 digest of `content` as of this version (64 characters). `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

  - `?int contentSizeBytes`

    Size of `content` in bytes as of this version. `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

  - `?ManagedAgentsActor createdBy`

    Who made this change to the memory, or `null` if the author wasn't recorded.

    Redacting the version doesn't change this field. A `session_actor` here is an agent that wrote through the store's mounted filesystem at `/mnt/memory/`. The version doesn't record the API key that created that session. So the author in `created_by` is who made the change, not who is ultimately responsible for it.

  - `?string path`

    The memory's path at the time of this write. `null` if and only if `redacted_at` is set.

  - `?\Datetime redactedAt`

    When the version was redacted, in RFC 3339, or `null` if it hasn't been.

    When set, `content`, `path`, `content_size_bytes`, and `content_sha256` are `null`.

### Retrieve a Memory Version

`$client->beta->memoryStores->memoryVersions->retrieve(string memoryVersionID, string memoryStoreID, ?ManagedAgentsMemoryView view, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas, ?string workspaceID): ManagedAgentsMemoryVersion`

**GET** `/v1/memory_stores/{memory_store_id}/memory_versions/{memory_version_id}`

Retrieve a Memory Version

#### Parameters

- `memoryStoreID: string` (path parameter)

  The ID of the memory store that holds the version (`memstore_...`).

- `memoryVersionID: string` (path parameter)

  The ID of the memory version to retrieve (`memver_...`).

- `view?:optional ManagedAgentsMemoryView` (query parameter)

  Whether a `memory` or `memory_version` in the response includes its `content`. Defaults to `full` on retrieve operations and to `basic` on list, create, and update operations.

  With `full`, list operations return at most 20 items per page.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>` (header parameter)

  This endpoint is in beta: requests must send `agent-memory-2026-07-22` or `managed-agents-2026-04-01` in this header.

- `workspaceID?:optional string` (header parameter)

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

#### Returns

- `class ManagedAgentsMemoryVersion`

  - `"memory_version" type`

  - `string id`

    Unique identifier for this version (a `memver_...` value).

  - `\Datetime createdAt`

    When this version was written, in RFC 3339 format.

  - `string memoryID`

    The ID of the memory that this version belongs to (`mem_...`).

    The ID stays valid after the memory is deleted. Pass it as `memory_id` to [List Memory Versions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/list?sdk_languages=php) to get the memory's retained versions, including its `deleted` version while the lineage is retained.

  - `string memoryStoreID`

    ID of the memory store this version belongs to (a `memstore_...` value).

  - `ManagedAgentsMemoryVersionOperation operation`

    The kind of mutation this version records: `created`, `modified`, or `deleted`.

  - `?string content`

    The memory's UTF-8 text content as of this version. `null` when `view=basic`, when `operation` is `deleted`, or when `redacted_at` is set.

  - `?string contentSha256`

    Lowercase hex SHA-256 digest of `content` as of this version (64 characters). `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

  - `?int contentSizeBytes`

    Size of `content` in bytes as of this version. `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

  - `?ManagedAgentsActor createdBy`

    Who made this change to the memory, or `null` if the author wasn't recorded.

    Redacting the version doesn't change this field. A `session_actor` here is an agent that wrote through the store's mounted filesystem at `/mnt/memory/`. The version doesn't record the API key that created that session. So the author in `created_by` is who made the change, not who is ultimately responsible for it.

    You can [retrieve the session](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/sessions/retrieve?sdk_languages=php) to learn more about where the change came from.

  - `?string path`

    The memory's path at the time of this write. `null` if and only if `redacted_at` is set.

  - `?\Datetime redactedAt`

    When the version was redacted, in RFC 3339, or `null` if it hasn't been.

    When set, `content`, `path`, `content_size_bytes`, and `content_sha256` are `null`.

    See the [memory guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/memory?sdk_languages=php#redact-a-version) to learn more about redaction.

  - `?ManagedAgentsActor redactedBy`

    Who redacted this version, or `null` if it has not been redacted. In practice always an `api_actor`, `user_actor`, or `service_account_actor` (agents do not have a redact capability).

#### Example

```php
<?php

require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Anthropic\Client;
use Anthropic\Beta\AnthropicBeta;
use Anthropic\Beta\MemoryStores\Memories\ManagedAgentsMemoryView;
