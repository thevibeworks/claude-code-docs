# Retrieve a memory version

`$client->beta->memoryStores->memoryVersions->retrieve(string memoryVersionID, string memoryStoreID, ?ManagedAgentsMemoryView view, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas, ?string workspaceID): ManagedAgentsMemoryVersion`

**GET** `/v1/memory_stores/{memory_store_id}/memory_versions/{memory_version_id}`

Retrieve a memory version

## Parameters

- `memoryStoreID: string`

  The ID of the memory store that holds the version (`memstore_...`).

- `memoryVersionID: string`

  The ID of the memory version to retrieve (`memver_...`).

- `view?:optional ManagedAgentsMemoryView`

  Selects which projection of a `memory` or `memory_version` the server returns. `basic` returns the object with `content` set to `null`; `full` populates `content`. When omitted, the default is endpoint-specific: retrieve operations default to `full`; list, create, and update operations default to `basic`. Listing with `view=full` caps `limit` at 20.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

- `workspaceID?:optional string`

  Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

  Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

## Returns

- `class ManagedAgentsMemoryVersion`

  - `Type type`

  - `string id`

    Unique identifier for this version (a `memver_...` value).

  - `\Datetime createdAt`

    When this version was written, in RFC 3339 format.

  - `string memoryID`

    ID of the memory this version snapshots (a `mem_...` value). Remains valid after the memory is deleted; pass it as `memory_id` to [List memory versions](/docs/en/api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/list) to retrieve the memory's retained versions, including the `deleted` row while the lineage is retained.

  - `string memoryStoreID`

    ID of the memory store this version belongs to (a `memstore_...` value).

  - `ManagedAgentsMemoryVersionOperation operation`

    The kind of mutation this version records: `created`, `modified`, or `deleted`.

  - `?string content`

    The memory's UTF-8 text content as of this version. `null` when `view=basic`, when `operation` is `deleted`, or when `redacted_at` is set.

  - `?string contentSha256`

    Lowercase hex SHA-256 digest of `content` as of this version (64 characters). `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

  - `?int contentSizeBytes`

    Size of `content` in bytes as of this version. `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

  - `?ManagedAgentsActor createdBy`

    Who performed this write: one of `session_actor`, `api_actor`, `user_actor`, or `service_account_actor`; `null` when no writer is recorded. Captured at write time and preserved through redaction. A `session_actor` is an agent writing through the store's mounted filesystem at `/mnt/memory/`. The API key that created that session is not recorded on agent writes, so attribution names who made the write, not who is ultimately responsible; look up session provenance via the [Sessions API](/docs/en/api/beta/sessions/retrieve).

  - `?string path`

    The memory's path at the time of this write. `null` if and only if `redacted_at` is set.

  - `?\Datetime redactedAt`

    When this version was redacted, in RFC 3339 format, or `null` if it has not been redacted. When set, `content`, `path`, `content_size_bytes`, and `content_sha256` are all `null`. See [Redact a memory version](/docs/en/api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/redact).

  - `?ManagedAgentsActor redactedBy`

    Who redacted this version, or `null` if it has not been redacted. In practice always an `api_actor`, `user_actor`, or `service_account_actor` (agents do not have a redact capability).

## Example

```php
<?php

require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Client(apiKey: 'my-anthropic-api-key');

$betaManagedAgentsMemoryVersion = $client
  ->beta
  ->memoryStores
  ->memoryVersions
  ->retrieve(
  'memory_version_id',
  memoryStoreID: 'memory_store_id',
  view: ManagedAgentsMemoryView::BASIC,
  betas: [AnthropicBeta::MESSAGE_BATCHES_2024_09_24],
  workspaceID: 'wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy',
);

var_dump($betaManagedAgentsMemoryVersion);
```
