# Service Accounts

## Create Service Account

**POST** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts`

Create a service account.

A service account is a named workload identity that federation rules
target. `organization_role` is `developer` (default) or `admin`; a rule
may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when the
target's `organization_role` is `admin`. Requires an OAuth bearer (user
or WIF-minted service account token) or a Console session; Admin API
keys are not accepted. Creating an `admin`-role service account requires
an interactive credential (a user OAuth token or a Console session) — a
workload may only create `developer`-role service accounts.

### Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Body parameters

- `name: string`

  Slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

  maxLength: 255, minLength: 1

- `description: optional string or null`

  Optional free-text description.

  maxLength: 2000

- `organization_role: optional "admin" or "developer"`

  Org-level role. Defaults to `developer`.

  - `"admin"`

  - `"developer"`

### Returns

- `ServiceAccount object`

  Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

  A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
  whatever references it (federation rules).

  - `id: string`

    Tagged ID of the service account.

  - `archived_at: string or null`

    If set, this service account is archived.

    format: date-time

  - `archived_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this service account.

  - `organization_role: "admin" or "developer"`

    Org-level role. A federation rule may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when this is `admin`. A rule granting `org:admin` whose target is later demoted to `developer` is rejected at token exchange. Rules granting `org:admin` are managed in the Console.

    - `"admin"`

    - `"developer"`

    default: service_account

  - `updated_at: string`

    When this service account was last updated.

## Service Accounts › Workspaces

### Add Workspace To Service Account

**POST** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

Add a service account to a workspace with the given `workspace_role`.

Mirror of `POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`, addressed
from the service-account side; both create the same membership. If the
service account is already an explicit member of the workspace, its
`workspace_role` is replaced with the value supplied here. Archived
workspaces return 400. Archived service accounts cannot be added and are
rejected. Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys
are not accepted.

#### Path parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

#### Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

  Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

- `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

  default: service_account_workspace_member

- `workspace_id: string`

  Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

}
```

### List Workspaces For Service Account

**GET** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

List the workspaces a service account is a member of.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role` in that
workspace. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. When the
service account has no explicit default-workspace membership, the
implicit (`implicit: true`) membership is returned as the first entry on
the first page; with `limit=1` the first page may return up to 2 entries
(the implicit entry plus one explicit membership) so a pagination cursor
can be derived. Memberships are returned only while
the service account is active; an archived service account returns an
empty list.

#### Path parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

#### Query parameters

- `limit: optional number`

  Number of results per page.

  default: 20, maximum: 100, minimum: 1

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

#### Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

#### Returns

- `data: array of object`

  - `created_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

  - `implicit: boolean or null`

    True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role workspace_user and cannot be removed.

  - `service_account_id: string`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

  - `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

    default: service_account_workspace_member

  - `workspace_id: string`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

  - `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_billing" or "workspace_developer" or 2 more`

    Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

    - `"workspace_admin"`

    - `"workspace_billing"`

    - `"workspace_developer"`

    - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

    - `"workspace_user"`

- `next_page: string or null`

  Opaque cursor for the next page, or null if no more results.

#### Example

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/service_accounts/$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID/workspaces \
    -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN"
```

##### Response (200)

```json

### Remove Workspace From Service Account

**DELETE** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces/{workspace_id}`

Remove a service account from a workspace.

Mirror of `DELETE /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`,
addressed from the service-account side. Removal is idempotent (returns
200 even if the membership was already removed). A DELETE against the
implicit default-workspace membership returns 200 but is a no-op and the
membership persists; deleting an explicit default-workspace row reverts
to the implicit `workspace_user` membership. Archived workspaces return
400. Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys are not
accepted.

#### Path parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

- `workspace_id: string`

  ID of the workspace.

#### Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.
