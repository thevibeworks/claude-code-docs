# List memory versions

`MemoryVersionListPage Beta.MemoryStores.MemoryVersions.List(parameters, cancellationToken = default)`

**GET** `/v1/memory_stores/{memory_store_id}/memory_versions`

List memory versions

## Parameters

- `MemoryVersionListParams parameters`

  - `required string memoryStoreID`

    Path param: The ID of the memory store whose version history to list (`memstore_...`).

  - `string apiKeyID`

    Query param: Return only versions written with the API key that has this ID.

  - `DateTimeOffset createdAtGte`

    Query param: Return versions created at or after this time (inclusive).

    format: date-time

  - `DateTimeOffset createdAtLte`

    Query param: Return versions created at or before this time (inclusive).

    format: date-time

  - `int limit`

    Query param: The maximum number of versions to return per page. Defaults to 20.

    format: int32

  - `string memoryID`

    Query param: Return only versions of the memory with this ID (`mem_...`).

    The filter still works after the memory is deleted. The results then include the version whose `operation` is `deleted`.

  - `BetaManagedAgentsMemoryVersionOperation operation`

    Query param: Return only versions that record this kind of change.

  - `string page`

    Query param: The `next_page` value from a previous response, to get the next page. Omit it to get the first page.

  - `string serviceAccountID`

    Query param: Return only versions written by the service account with this ID (`svac_...`).

  - `string sessionID`

    Query param: Return only versions written by the session with this ID.

  - `BetaManagedAgentsMemoryView view`

    Query param: Selects which projection of a `memory` or `memory_version` the server returns. `basic` returns the object with `content` set to `null`; `full` populates `content`. When omitted, the default is endpoint-specific: retrieve operations default to `full`; list, create, and update operations default to `basic`. Listing with `view=full` caps `limit` at 20.

  - `IReadOnlyList<AnthropicBeta> betas`

    Header param: Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  - `string workspaceID`

    Header param: Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

    Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.

## Returns

- `class BetaManagedAgentsMemoryVersion`

  A `memory_version` object: one immutable, attributed row in a memory's append-only history. Every non-no-op mutation to a memory produces a new version. Versions belong to the store (not the individual memory) and are not deleted with the memory; each version is retained for at least the version retention period after it was written, unless the store itself is deleted. Retrieving a redacted version returns 200 with `content`, `path`, `content_size_bytes`, and `content_sha256` set to `null`; branch on `redacted_at`, not HTTP status.

  - `required Type Type`

  - `required string ID`

    Unique identifier for this version (a `memver_...` value).

  - `required DateTimeOffset CreatedAt`

    When this version was written, in RFC 3339 format.

    format: date-time

  - `required string MemoryID`

    ID of the memory this version snapshots (a `mem_...` value). Remains valid after the memory is deleted; pass it as `memory_id` to [List memory versions](/docs/en/api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/list) to retrieve the memory's retained versions, including the `deleted` row while the lineage is retained.

  - `required string MemoryStoreID`

    ID of the memory store this version belongs to (a `memstore_...` value).

  - `required BetaManagedAgentsMemoryVersionOperation Operation`

    The kind of mutation this version records: `created`, `modified`, or `deleted`.

    - `Created("created")`

      The memory was created. The first version in any memory's lineage.

    - `Modified("modified")`

      The memory's `content`, `path`, or both were changed via update. Writes the agent makes through the filesystem mount also appear as `modified`.

    - `Deleted("deleted")`

      The memory was deleted. The `content`, `content_size_bytes`, and `content_sha256` fields are `null` on this version. The preceding version, while it is retained, records the deleted content's size and hash.

  - `string? Content`

    The memory's UTF-8 text content as of this version. `null` when `view=basic`, when `operation` is `deleted`, or when `redacted_at` is set.

  - `string? ContentSha256`

    Lowercase hex SHA-256 digest of `content` as of this version (64 characters). `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

  - `int? ContentSizeBytes`

    Size of `content` in bytes as of this version. `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

    format: int32

  - `BetaManagedAgentsActor CreatedBy`

    Who performed this write: one of `session_actor`, `api_actor`, `user_actor`, or `service_account_actor`; `null` when no writer is recorded. Captured at write time and preserved through redaction. A `session_actor` is an agent writing through the store's mounted filesystem at `/mnt/memory/`. The API key that created that session is not recorded on agent writes, so attribution names who made the write, not who is ultimately responsible; look up session provenance via the [Sessions API](/docs/en/api/beta/sessions/retrieve).

    - `class BetaManagedAgentsSessionActor`

      An agent acting during a session, for example through the session's mounted filesystem. It names the session itself, not the user or API key that started the session.

      - `required Type Type`

      - `required string SessionID`

        ID of the session (a `sesn_...` value). Look up the session via [Retrieve a session](/docs/en/api/beta/sessions/retrieve) for further provenance.

        minLength: 1

    - `class BetaManagedAgentsApiActor`

      A direct caller of the public API, identified by the API key that authenticated the request.

      - `required Type Type`

      - `required string ApiKeyID`

        ID of the API key (an `apikey_...` value). This identifies the key, not the secret.

        minLength: 1

    - `class BetaManagedAgentsUserActor`

      A human user, for example acting through the Anthropic Console.

      - `required Type Type`

      - `required string UserID`

        ID of the user (a `user_...` value).

        minLength: 1

    - `class BetaManagedAgentsServiceAccountActor`

      A workload authenticated as a service account, for example via Workload Identity Federation.

      - `JsonElement Type = "service_account_actor"`

      - `required string ServiceAccountID`

        ID of the service account (a `svac_...` value).

        minLength: 1

  - `string? Path`

    The memory's path at the time of this write. `null` if and only if `redacted_at` is set.

  - `DateTimeOffset? RedactedAt`

    When this version was redacted, in RFC 3339 format, or `null` if it has not been redacted. When set, `content`, `path`, `content_size_bytes`, and `content_sha256` are all `null`. See [Redact a memory version](/docs/en/api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/redact).

    format: date-time

  - `BetaManagedAgentsActor RedactedBy`

    Who redacted this version, or `null` if it has not been redacted. In practice always an `api_actor`, `user_actor`, or `service_account_actor` (agents do not have a redact capability).

## Example

```csharp
MemoryVersionListParams parameters = new()
{
    MemoryStoreID = "memory_store_id"
};

var page = await client.Beta.MemoryStores.MemoryVersions.List(parameters);
await foreach (var item in page.Paginate())
{
    Console.WriteLine(item);
}
```
