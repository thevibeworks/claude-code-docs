Enterprise and Team customers can now upgrade to premium seats that include more usage and Claude Code—bringing our app and powerful coding agent together under one subscription. Users can move seamlessly between ideation and implementation, while admins get the visibility and controls they need to scale Claude across their organization.

We are also introducing a new Compliance API, giving organizations programmatic access to usage data and customer content for better observability, auditing, and governance.

Add Claude Code to your plan
----------------------------

Admins have full flexibility to assign standard or premium seats according to individual user requirements and organizational roles. Premium seats give users access to both Claude and Claude Code, enabling them to partner with Claude throughout the entire development lifecycle.

For example, developers can research unfamiliar frameworks through interactive chats with Claude, then implement production-ready code using Claude Code in their terminal. They can explore architectural approaches and evaluate trade-offs in Claude conversations, then switch to Claude Code to build their chosen architecture.

Early customers like Behavox, a compliance and security company, have seen immediate results. “Since bundling Claude for Enterprise with Claude Code, we’ve rolled it out to hundreds of developers, and it has quickly become our go-to pair programmer,” shares Artem Pikulin, Senior Manager of Machine Learning Operations. “Its coding assistance consistently outperforms other agents, delivering superior results and value every day.”

Altana, the AI-powered Product Network connecting the global supply chain, has experienced similar transformational results. “Claude Code and Claude have accelerated Altana's development velocity by 2-10x, transforming how we build sophisticated AI/ML systems that facilitate multi-party collaboration on large-scale knowledge graphs of global supply chains,” says Peter Swartz, Co-founder and Chief Science Officer. “We're taking on significantly more ambitious projects as a result.”

Flexible pricing, predictable costs
-----------------------------------

Claude seats include enough usage for a typical workday, but for times when your teams need access to more intelligence and additional conversations with Claude–admins can enable extra usage for individual users at standard API rates. Admins have control over the maximum amount a user can spend with extra usage to ensure that users get flexibility and admins get predictable billing.

This approach provides a simple way to scale with Claude, while offering centralized billing, management, and enterprise-grade administrative controls at every step.

Admin control and management
----------------------------

We've built new comprehensive controls that give organizations the visibility and management capabilities they need to enable employees to work productively with Claude.

*   **Self-serve seat management**: Purchase new seats, directly manage seat allocation, and provision users through the admin panel.
*   **Granular spend controls:**Set spending limits at the organization and individual user level to stay within budget while maintaining flexibility for essential projects.
*   **Usage analytics**: View Claude Code analytics in Claude, including metrics like lines of code accepted, suggestion accept rate, and usage patterns.
*   **Managed policy settings**: Deploy and enforce settings across all Claude Code users to match internal policies, including tool permissions, file access restrictions, and MCP server configurations.

Compliance API
--------------

Enterprise organizations can now better meet regulatory requirements with our new Compliance API. Rather than manual exports and periodic reviews, compliance teams get real-time programmatic access to Claude usage data and customer content, enabling them to build continuous monitoring and automated policy enforcement systems.

Administrators can integrate Claude data into existing compliance dashboards, automatically flag potential issues, and manage data retention through selective deletion capabilities. This provides the visibility and control organizations need to scale AI adoption while meeting regulatory obligations.

Getting started
