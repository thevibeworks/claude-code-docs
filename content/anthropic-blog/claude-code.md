Working…

### Powerful intelligence

*   Uses agentic search to understand your entire codebase without manual context selection
*   Makes coordinated changes across multiple files
*   Optimized specifically for code understanding and generation with Claude Opus 4.1

### Works where you work

*   Lives right inside your terminal—no context switching
*   Integrates with VS Code and JetBrains IDEs
*   Leverages your test suites and build systems

### You’re in control

*   Never modifies your files without explicit approval
*   Adapts to your coding standards and patterns
*   Configurable; build on the SDK or run on GitHub Actions

### Works with your IDEs

Claude works directly in VS Code and JetBrains, seeing your entire codebase instead of just isolated snippets. It understands your project structure and existing patterns, making suggestions that actually fit and presenting them directly in your code files. No copying and pasting—just building.

### ... and your favorite command line tools

Your terminal is where real work happens. Claude Code connects with the tools that power development—deployment, databases, monitoring, version control. Rather than adding another interface to juggle, it enhances your existing stack. Less context-switching.

I'm an infra and backend guy, but with Claude 3.5 Sonnet being so good, I now feel like I'm an everything guy.

Claude Code has dramatically accelerated our team's coding efficiency. I can now write EDA code in a notebook—pulling data, training a model, and evaluating it with basic metrics—and then ask Claude to convert that into a Metaflow pipeline. This process saves 1-2 days of routine (and often boring!) work per model.

Claude Code marks a threshold moment for AI in software development. At Intercom, it enables us to build applications we wouldn’t have had bandwidth for—from AI labeling tools to ROI calculators for our Sales team. Its ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks sets it apart from alternatives. Claude Code is fundamentally changing what’s possible for our engineering teams.
