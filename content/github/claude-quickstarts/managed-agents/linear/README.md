# Linear × Claude Managed Agents

`@mention` a Claude [Managed Agent](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview) in a Linear issue, or assign the issue to it, and get the reply as a comment. The bridge is stateless: the session's `metadata` (`linear_session_id`, `linear_org_id`) is the only routing state, so there is no database and no mapping table.

```

## Quickstart

Needs [Bun](https://bun.sh/), the [`ant` CLI](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/cli-sdks-libraries/cli/quickstart) 1.30 or later (`brew install anthropics/tap/ant`), a public HTTPS tunnel such as ngrok, admin rights on a Linear workspace, and Anthropic auth: `ant auth login` once, or an API key from [platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com/).

```bash
cd managed-agents/linear
bun install
claude "walk me through setting this up"   # reads skill.md and drives the rest
```

Claude walks through the Linear OAuth app, the agent and webhook, the env vars, and `bun run dev` in the order that works.

Or by hand:

```bash
ant auth login                  # or export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
ant apply agents environments   # creates the agent + environment, records their IDs in claude-lock.json
cp .env.example .env            # then follow the local dev checklist in skill.md for the Linear and webhook halves
bun run dev
```

[`ant apply`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/cli-sdks-libraries/cli/apply) reads the agent from [`agents/linear-assistant.md`](agents/linear-assistant.md), whose frontmatter is the configuration and whose prose is the system prompt, and the environment from [`environments/linear-assistant.yaml`](environments/linear-assistant.yaml). It shows the plan and creates both once you approve, and the bridge reads their IDs from the `claude-lock.json` it writes. To change the agent (model, prompt, tools), edit its file and run a bare `ant apply`, which reconciles every file the lockfile tracks and publishes a new version of the same agent. This repository ignores `claude-lock.json`, since every reader creates their own resources. In a project of your own, commit it.

## Before you expose it

`/oauth/authorize` has no login in front of it, and every mention from an installed workspace runs a session on your Anthropic credentials. So the first Linear workspace to install owns the bridge, and installs from any other workspace are refused and revoked. To pin that choice, or to serve more than one workspace, set `LINEAR_ALLOWED_ORG_IDS` in `.env` (the server logs the organization ID on install). See `skill.md`, "Issue text is untrusted input", for what a mention can make the agent do.

## Files

| | |
|---|---|
| `agents/linear-assistant.md`, `environments/linear-assistant.yaml` | The agent and its environment, as files for `ant apply` |
| `src/resources.ts` | Reads the agent and environment IDs from `claude-lock.json`, falling back to `CLAUDE_*_ID` where it has no entry |
| `src/main.ts` | Bun server, routes |
| `src/oauth.ts` | Linear OAuth (`actor=app`, single-use `state`) + token store |
| `src/agent.ts` | `sessions.create` + `user.message` with routing metadata |
| `src/managed-agents-webhook.ts` | `beta.webhooks.unwrap` → filter by metadata → post reply |
| `skill.md` | Mental model, gotchas, setup checklist, debugging |

Requires `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ≥ 0.109.0.
