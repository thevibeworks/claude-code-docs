> Get answers to questions about a document's content with relevant citations supporting the response.

<Tip>We recommend using the [citation feature](/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations) built into the API instead of a prompt based approach. Using the API citation feature will improve citation quality, ensure that all returned citations are valid, and potentially reduce the number of needed output tokens.</Tip>

## Example output

Quotes:\
\[1] "We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to \$136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately \$111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021."\
\[2] "Our gross profit decreased by \$8.1 million or 14%, to \$51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from \$60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022."\
\[3] "Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform."

Answer:\
Matterport has experienced rapid subscriber and revenue growth in recent years. \[1] However, their gross profit declined in 2022 due to supply chain issues. \[2] Their net dollar expansion rate indicates strong subscriber retention and potential for continued growth. \[3] Overall, despite the dip in gross profit, Matterport's subscriber and revenue growth, along with their platform's stickiness, suggest the company is doing relatively well.
