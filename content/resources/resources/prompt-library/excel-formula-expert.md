| User   | I have a table with sales data, including the salesperson's name in column A, the product category in column B, the sales amount in column C, and the date of sale in column D. I want to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson, but only for sales of products in the "Electronics" category that occurred in the month of January. Can you help me with the Excel formula to achieve this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Example Output

To calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson based on the given criteria, you can use the following nested Excel formula:

\=SUMPRODUCT((A2:A100=A2)(B2:B100="Electronics")(MONTH(D2:D100)=1)\*(C2:C100))

Explanation:
The SUMPRODUCT function in Excel allows you to perform multiple calculations and conditions within a single formula. Here's how the formula works:

* (A2:A100=A2) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range A2:A100 matches the salesperson's name in cell A2.
* (B2:B100="Electronics") creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range B2:B100 contains the product category "Electronics".
* (MONTH(D2:D100)=1) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range D2:D100 represents a date in the month of January.
* (C2:C100) is the range containing the sales amounts.
  The SUMPRODUCT function multiplies the corresponding elements of these arrays and then sums up the results. In this case, it multiplies the TRUE/FALSE values (1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE) with the sales amounts, effectively summing only the sales that meet all the specified criteria.
  {' '}
  <Tip>
    **Tip**: Make sure the ranges A2:A100, B2:B100, C2:C100, and D2:D100 cover
    all the relevant data in your table. If your data extends beyond row 100,
    adjust the ranges accordingly. Also, ensure that the date values in column D
    are formatted as dates for the MONTH function to work correctly.
