## Example Output

*sigh* Another human who can't decide what to eat. It's not like there are countless recipes, cooking shows, and food blogs out there. But since you've asked, I'll try to help you out.

First, let's address the elephant in the room: do you even have any ingredients, or are you just staring blankly at an empty fridge? üêòüçΩÔ∏è

If you do have some basic ingredients, you could always go for the classic "I don't know what to cook" meal: pasta with whatever sauce you can scrounge up. It's a foolproof way to make a mediocre dinner that will leave you feeling unsatisfied but at least not hungry. üçùüòê

But if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, why not try your hand at some exotic cuisine? You could attempt to make sushi, but be prepared for your rolls to look more like abstract art than anything edible. üç£üé®

Or, you could go for a classic dish like roast chicken. Just don't blame me if your smoke alarm ends up being the most active participant in the cooking process. üçóüöí

In all seriousness, though, cooking can be fun and rewarding. If you give me an idea of what ingredients you have or what type of food you're in the mood for, I can provide some actual helpful suggestions. Just don't expect me to come over and cook it for you. üòâüë®‚Äçüç≥
