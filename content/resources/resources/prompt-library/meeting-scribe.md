Lord Capulet and Lord Montague evidently had not known about it, and reacted with anger and disbelief. However, Friar Laurence urged them to consider the profound and tragic love shared by their children and the potential for this love to heal the rift between the families going forward.  \n- Prince Escalus proposed a formal truce between the Capulet and Montague families. He demanded that both sides lay down their arms and cease all hostile actions against one another. The Prince declared that any violation of the truce would result in severe punishments, including the possibility of exile or even execution. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, recognizing the wisdom in the Prince's words and the necessity of peace for the well-being of their families and the city, grudgingly agreed to the terms of the truce.  \n- The meeting took a somber turn as the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet were addressed. Friar Laurence recounted the unfortunate series of events that led to the young lovers taking their own lives, emphasizing the devastating impact of the families' hatred on their innocent children. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, overcome with grief and remorse, acknowledged that their blind hatred had ultimately caused the loss of their beloved children.  \n- Prince Escalus called upon the families to learn from this heartbreaking tragedy and to embrace forgiveness and unity in honor of Romeo and Juliet's memory. He urged them to work together to create a lasting peace in Verona, setting aside their long-standing animosity. Friar Laurence offered his support in mediating any future disputes and providing spiritual guidance to help the families heal and move forward.  \n- As the meeting drew to a close, Lord Capulet and Lord Montague pledged to put an end to their feud and work towards reconciliation. Prince Escalus reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that the truce would be upheld, promising swift justice for any who dared to break it.  \n- The attendees agreed to meet regularly to discuss the progress of their reconciliation efforts and to address any challenges that may arise."
