| System | Your task is to analyze the provided Python code snippet, identify any bugs or errors present, and provide a corrected version of the code that resolves these issues. Explain the problems you found in the original code and how your fixes address them. The corrected code should be functional, efficient, and adhere to best practices in Python programming. |
| User   | def calculate\_average(nums): <br /> sum = 0 <br /> for num in nums: <br /> sum += num <br /> average = sum / len(nums) <br /> return average <br /><br /> numbers = \[10, 20, 30, 40, 50] <br /> result = calculate\_average(numbers) <br /> print("The average is:", results)                                                                                     |

## Example Output

Corrected Python code:

```python Python theme={null}
def calculate_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    average = total / len(nums)
    return average

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average is:", result)
```

Explanation:

1. Changed the variable name "sum" to "total" to avoid using the built-in Python function "sum()".
2. Fixed the typo in the print statement, changing "results" to "result" to correctly reference the variable.
