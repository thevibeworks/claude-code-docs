What you can do
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the ways you can use Claude Code:

Automate the work you keep putting off

Claude Code handles the tedious tasks that eat up your day: writing tests for untested code, fixing lint errors across a project, resolving merge conflicts, updating dependencies, and writing release notes.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude "write tests for the auth module, run them, and fix any failures"
```

Build features and fix bugs

Describe what you want in plain language. Claude Code plans the approach, writes the code across multiple files, and verifies it works.For bugs, paste an error message or describe the symptom. Claude Code traces the issue through your codebase, identifies the root cause, and implements a fix. See [common workflows](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/common-workflows) for more examples.

Create commits and pull requests

Claude Code works directly with git. It stages changes, writes commit messages, creates branches, and opens pull requests.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude "commit my changes with a descriptive message"
```

In CI, you can automate code review and issue triage with [GitHub Actions](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/github-actions) or [GitLab CI/CD](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd).

Connect your tools with MCP

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/mcp) is an open standard for connecting AI tools to external data sources. With MCP, Claude Code can read your design docs in Google Drive, update tickets in Jira, pull data from Slack, or use your own custom tooling.

Customize with instructions, skills, and hooks

[`CLAUDE.md`](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/memory) is a markdown file you add to your project root that Claude Code reads at the start of every session. Use it to set coding standards, architecture decisions, preferred libraries, and review checklists. Claude also builds [auto memory](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/memory#auto-memory) as it works, saving learnings like build commands and debugging insights across sessions without you writing anything.Create [custom slash commands](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/skills) to package repeatable workflows your team can share, like `/review-pr` or `/deploy-staging`.[Hooks](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/hooks) let you run shell commands before or after Claude Code actions, like auto-formatting after every file edit or running lint before a commit.

Run agent teams and build custom agents

Spawn [multiple Claude Code agents](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/sub-agents) that work on different parts of a task simultaneously. A lead agent coordinates the work, assigns subtasks, and merges results.For fully custom workflows, the [Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) lets you build your own agents powered by Claude Code’s tools and capabilities, with full control over orchestration, tool access, and permissions.

Pipe, script, and automate with the CLI

Claude Code is composable and follows the Unix philosophy. Pipe logs into it, run it in CI, or chain it with other tools:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Monitor logs and get alerted
tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies"

# Automate translations in CI
claude -p "translate new strings into French and raise a PR for review"

# Bulk operations across files
git diff main --name-only | claude -p "review these changed files for security issues"
```

See the [CLI reference](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/cli-reference) for the full set of commands and flags.

Work from anywhere

Sessions aren’t tied to a single surface. Move work between environments as your context changes:
*   Step away from your desk and keep working from your phone or any browser with [Remote Control](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/remote-control)
*   Kick off a long-running task on the [web](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) or [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/claude-by-anthropic/id6473753684), then pull it into your terminal with `/teleport`
*   Hand off a terminal session to the [Desktop app](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/desktop) with `/desktop` for visual diff review
*   Route tasks from team chat: mention `@Claude` in [Slack](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/slack) with a bug report and get a pull request back

[​](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#use-claude-code-everywhere)

Use Claude Code everywhere
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each surface connects to the same underlying Claude Code engine, so your CLAUDE.md files, settings, and MCP servers work across all of them.Beyond the [Terminal](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/quickstart), [VS Code](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/vs-code), [JetBrains](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/jetbrains), [Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/desktop), and [Web](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) environments above, Claude Code integrates with CI/CD, chat, and browser workflows:

| I want to… | Best option |
| --- | --- |
| Continue a local session from my phone or another device | [Remote Control](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/remote-control) |
| Start a task locally, continue on mobile | [Web](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) or [Claude iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/claude-by-anthropic/id6473753684) |
| Automate PR reviews and issue triage | [GitHub Actions](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/github-actions) or [GitLab CI/CD](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd) |
| Route bug reports from Slack to pull requests | [Slack](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/slack) |
| Debug live web applications | [Chrome](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/en/chrome) |
| Build custom agents for your own workflows | [Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) |
